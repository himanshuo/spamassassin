Title: CATALISE - Delphi study
Description: Lack of agreement about terminology and diagnostic criteria is recognised as a major problem in the field of children's language disorders . It has held back research and led to wide variations in practice in terms of which children get support. Across the English-speaking world, there is lack of agreement both within and between countries. A Delphi consensus process will be used to devise an acceptable set of criteria for identifying children with significant language difficulties, and a second exercise to consider appropriate terminology.
