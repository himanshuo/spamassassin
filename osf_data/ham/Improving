Title: Improving Life Chances of Disadvantaged Youth: Testing Best-Practice Academic vs. Non-Academic Supports Through a Large-Scale Randomized Control Trial in Chicago
Description: The University of Chicago Crime Lab is conducting two closely-interconnected large-scale randomized social experiments in close collaboration with the Chicago Public Schools (CPS), to learn more about the relative cost-effectiveness of investing in academic skills vs. non-academic factors that affect youth life outcomes, the synergy of investing in both domains simultaneously, and the key mediators and moderators of these effects.
