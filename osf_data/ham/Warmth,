Title: Warmth, Class, and Political Participation-1
Description: The current study attempts to frame the political process in terms of warmth and competence, two dimensions cross-culturally relied upon in perceiving others (Cuddy, Fiske, &amp; Glick, 2008) and politicians  (Todorov, Baron, &amp; Oosterhof, 2008; Todorov, Mandisodza, Goren, &amp; Hall, 2005). Based on evidence that lower-class individuals are more interdependent (Stephens, Markus, &amp; Townsend, 2007) and exhibit lower levels of generalized trust (Fiske, Moya, Russell, &amp; Bearns, 2012), we expect such individuals to indicate more willingness and be more likely to take part in the political process when it is framed in terms of warmth rather than competence. This is the first of three planned studies in which we exposed students to persuasive essays and asked them to indicate their behavior intentions to take part in student elections at their university. We also gave them a chance to volunteer for a voting initiative, and, finally, asked them whether or not they voted in student elections in a follow-up survey.
