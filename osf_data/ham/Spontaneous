Title: Spontaneous trait inferences in social media
Description: This project is part of the ERC Starting Grant project Redefining Tie Strength of Prof. Dr. Sonja Utz (KMRC, Tübingen). In a series of experiments, we investigate whether and how spontaneous trait inferences (STIs) are made from self-generated behavioral descriptions written from first-person perspective and presented as social media updates.
