Title: Agentic appeals act as a catalyst for giving among the affluent
Description: When are wealthy individuals inspired to give? While past work suggests that wealth decreases prosocial behavior, we demonstrate that selfishness is not an inherent outcome of financial success. In two field studies (N = 401), we showed participants an ad for a charitable organization and manipulated whether the ad emphasized agency (the pursuit of personal goals) or communion (the pursuit of shared goals). When charitable appeals emphasized agency, wealthier individuals reported greater charitable intentions and donated more money to charity, thereby reversing the previously documented negative relationship between wealth and generosity. Together, these studies point to a simple way of encouraging charitable giving among the affluent: reframe charitable giving as an act consistent with agentic goals and motivations.
