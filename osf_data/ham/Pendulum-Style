Title: Pendulum-Style Electric Generators
Description: Gravity, as we know, is more reliable than sunshine. Fortunately, a device may convert a single activating infusion of energy into otherwise gravity-powered momentum that oscillates direction while the force of its movement is converted into electrical energy. Such a device may be known as a pendulum-style electric generator. What we are working to learn is how to optimize this approach to transforming the initial inputs of surplus motor energy into the final outputs of electrical energy. In other words, given a few different ways to make these devices, which combinations of variables work best for which users in which contexts?
