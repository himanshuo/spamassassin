Title: Situating Language Processing in Gameplay Modulates Event-Related Potentials of Morphosyntactic Processing
Description: We examined the neural processes of language processing within the context of gameplay. We hypothesized that presenting images of gameplay alongside sentences would increase participant motivation and attention resulting in modulated EEG amplitudes. 
Participants read sentences describing chess moves that contained either grammatical or morphosyntax violations then viewed chess images, unrelated images, or no images. Our findings suggest that language-processing tasks situated within the presentation of images elicited more robust ERP responses to morphosyntactic violations.
