Title: Experiment: Color Red, Working Memory Capacity, and IQ Test Performance
Description: It has been demonstrated in previous research that brief exposure to the color red impairs performance in a subsequent IQ test. In the present experiment we examine whether this red effect is moderated by dispositional working memory capacity.

Experiment: Color Red, Working Memory Capacity, and IQ Test Performance
It has been demonstrated in previous research that brief exposure to the color red impairs performance in a subsequent IQ test. In the present experiment we examine whether this red effect is moderated by dispositional working memory capacity.
