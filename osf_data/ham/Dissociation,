Title: Dissociation, executive function and emotional processing
Description: This project aims to investigate the trait of dissociation in a non-clinical sample and how it affects executive functions and emotional processing capabilities. To do this we will test participants who completed the Dissociative Experiences Scale on a task-switching paradigm using happy and angry faces, and contrast response speed and accuracy on switch versus non-switch trials and on happy versus angry trials.
