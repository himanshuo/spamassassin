Title: Taking a step back to think: Embodied Metaphors and Dual-Process Reasoning
Description: 	Embodied cognition research focuses on the role of the body’s motor systems, perceptual systems, and interactions with the environment as contributions to cognition (Dijkstra, Eerland, Zijlmans, &amp; Post, 2014; Hauk &amp; Tschentscher, 2013). The human understanding of the world is deeply grounded in physical metaphors (Gallese &amp; Lakoff, 2005; Dijkstra et al., 2014). Commonly used phrases such as “taking a step back to think” and “jumping to conclusions” are rooted in bodily movement and are considered embodied metaphors; such that recreation of these phrases with physical movement may influence various forms of reasoning. These phrases seem to be rooted in the dual-process systems of human reasoning, a theoretical framework that describes System 1 as heuristic-based and intuitive and System 2 as analytic-based and deductive (Johnson-Laird, 2010; Gillard, Schaeken, Van Dooren, &amp; Verschaffel, 2011; Reyna, 2004).The objective of the current study is to investigate the reach of these embodied metaphors in human reasoning.
