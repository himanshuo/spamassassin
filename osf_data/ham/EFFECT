Title: EFFECT OF GLASS MARKINGS ON DRINKING RATE AND DRINKING TOPOGRAPHY IN SOCIAL ALCOHOL DRINKERS
Description: We plan to investigate whether marking the ¼, ½, and ¾ volume points on the glass makes drinking rates from curved glasses more similar to those from straight glasses, by providing information to counteract the perceptual error in the judgement of volume. This would have real world impact as it will suggest that drawing attention to accurate volume information on shaped glasses, or restricting the use of shaped glasses in bars and clubs, might reduce drinking rates.
