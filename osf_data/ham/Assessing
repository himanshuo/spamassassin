Title: Assessing the Replication Bayes Factor: The Case of Global Versus Local Priming
Description: A direct replication of two experiments of Förster and Denzler (2012), including a calculation and discussion of three different Bayes factors as outlined by Verhagen and Wagenmakers (2014). Special emphasis will be placed upon assessing the use of the Replication Bayes factors in quantifying the success of a replication.
