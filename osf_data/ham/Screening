Title: Screening Attitudes Survey
Description: We are interested in how often individuals would state that they would have a screening test given different framing of information. Information will be targeted at men concerning prostate cancer, and at women concerning breast cancer. This cancer screening information will be framed as one of the following: a new test which offers no benefit the the participant, a test that has been used for the past 30 years but has now been shown to offer no benefit the the participant, or a well known test (mammography for women, PSA screening for men) that has been used for the past 30 years but has now been shown to offer no benefit the the participant 
Given these scenarios we hope to discover how often people are willing to be screened when they are told screening has no benefits. Further, we hope to find out how acceptance of well-known tests, such as mammography and PSA screening, differ from tests with the same background information but without familiar names, and how both of these differ from a novel testing technique.
