Title: Revisiting Schachter’s Research on Rejection, Deviance, and Communication
Description: We propose a replication of the original Schachter (1951) deviation-rejection study. Schachter’s ground-breaking demonstration of the deviation-rejection link has captivated social psychologists for decades. The findings and paradigm were so compelling that the deviation-rejection link is often taken for granted and sometimes may be misrepresented (Berkowitz, 1971; Wahrman & Pugh, 1972). Because there have only been two direct replications, one of which by the original author, we believe it is important to revisit the original study.
