Title: Atimia
Description: Atimia is a social interaction paradigm intended to manipulate burden, cooperation, ostracism, and stigma (though not limited to these areas of inquiry). By using the included generator to specify or select from several variables, researchers can harness Atimia’s robust features to easily configure an experimental manipulation. Moreover, Atimia integrates with experimental software (e.g., retrieving participant and condition numbers from MediaLab), outputs data, is compatible with mobile (in dev.) and desktop operating systems, and can run online (in dev.). Note. Atimia 2.0 succeeds Atimia 1.0 in features, reliability, and intuitiveness.
