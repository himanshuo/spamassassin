Title: Ebbinghaus (1880) Replication
Description: Stimuli, analysis files (Mathematica 9), and data in Excel from a successful replication of Hermann Ebbinghaus’ classic forgetting curve from 1880 based on the method of savings. One subject spent 70 hours learning lists and relearning them after 20 min, 1 hour, 9 hours, 1 day, 2 days, or 31 days. The results are similar to Ebbinghaus (1880).
