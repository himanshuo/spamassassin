Title: CSC490 Research Project
Description: In this project, we will be reproducing the results of Dr. Shan Sutharan's "Sensor Data Boundary Estimation for Anomaly Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks." The algorithms used will be re-written in Python and benchmarked against the original datasets used to create a performance standard for use in followup research assignments.
