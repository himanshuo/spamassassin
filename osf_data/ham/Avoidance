Title: Avoidance of random negative events
Description: This experiments will test if pupil dilation can predict the appearance of one neutral image (a smile) and a negative one (a gun associated with an acoustic “bang”). When a negative stimulus is predicted, it will be blocked and not presented. This experiment is fundamental to test if prediction is based on an anticipation of future sensory stimulation or simply of its “potential” emotional value.
