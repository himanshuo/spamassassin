Title: Addition Support for Brethel-Haurwitz & Marsh: Geographical differences in subjective well-being also predict internet interest in extraordinary alturism
Description: Contains data for a quick conceptual replication of the finding by Brethel-Haurwitz et al. that extraordinary altruism (state-wide rates of kidney donation) is correlated with subjective well-being.  In this case, I used internet interest in kidney donation (state-wide rates of searching for "kidney donation" on Google) and found the same correlation with 2013 state-wide subjective well-being.
