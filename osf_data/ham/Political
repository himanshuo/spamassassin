Title: Political preference and the disgust response
Description: This study is investigating the relationship between political preference and the disgust response. In order to measure the disgust response the Disgust Scale developed by Haidt, McCauley &amp; Rozin (1994) is used. Previous studies have shown a relationship between political preference and sensitivity to disgust where individuals who are more politically conservative also report being more easily disgusted (Inbar, Pizarro &amp; Bloom, 2009).
