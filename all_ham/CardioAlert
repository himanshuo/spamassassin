Title: CardioAlert
Description: The possibility to exploit the predictive anticipatory activity to predict random negative events will be investigated by using a portable apparatus we named CardioAlert (CA). This apparatus is devised to use the heart rate of each individual to send an alert when a negative or a positive future event presented randomly is going to happen.
