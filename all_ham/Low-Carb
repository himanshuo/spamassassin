Title: Low-Carb vs. Low-Fat Weight Loss Study: Seeking explanations for heterogeneity of response
Description: This 12-month protocol involves randomizing 600 adults, ages 18-50 years, with BMI 28-40, to a Low-Fat vs. Low-Carb diet, with a primary outcome of weight loss. Based on previous studies, anticipated 12-month weight loss in both groups is expected to range from roughly 0 - 50 pounds, with no average difference between groups. We hypothesize that differences in genotype, insulin resistance, and microbiota, among other factors, will explain significant portions of the heterogeneity within each treatment arm. Given problems in previous studies with diet assignment adherence and assessment of adherence, particular attention will be given to improving these factors. Rather than seeking to answer the question of which of the two is the "best" diets, we are seeking to determine "which is the best diet for who?".
