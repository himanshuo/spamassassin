Title: Semantic Architecture of Universal Human Emotions Hypothesis
Description: The Semantic Architecture of Universal Human Emotions Hypothesis posits two classes of expectation--each measurable on interval scales--that exist as components of an individual's world-concept or schema such that specific points or regions on a quadrant map of those two classes represented as orthogonal axes correlate to five qualitatively distinct universal human emotions: fear, anger, joy, disgust, and sorrow. Stated briefly, one class of expectation pertains to self-efficacy beliefs and the other to expectations regarding the validating recognition of and acting with favorable respect to one's subjective experiences and preferences. This hypothesis was generated and is explained using theoretical assumptions from cybernetics, Locke & Latham's goal theory, Fishbein's expectancy-value theory, Osgood's semantic differential, Ekman's research regarding facial expressions, Bandura's self-efficacy theory, as well as the theoretical frameworks of multiple person-centered psychotherapeutic approaches (e.g., Rogers, Kelly, Miller & Rollnick, etc.) and Csikszentmihalyi's work regarding flow.
