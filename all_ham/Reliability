Title: Reliability in infant speech perception
Description: A long line of research investigates how  infants learn  the sounds and words in their ambient language over
the first year of life. Much of this research relies on behavioral tasks involving discrimination and recognition. More recently, individual performance in such tasks has been used to predict later language development. Does this mean that dependent measures in such tasks are reliable and can stably measure speech perception skills over short time spans? We addressed this question in 7 experiments (with a total of 289 data points), in which infants were tested in a given task, and retested within 0-18 days. Tasks ranged from vowel and consonant discrimination to recognition of phrasal units. Results reveal that reliability is greatly affected by the specific stimuli and task being used. Additionally, reliability may be greater when there is a shorter delay between the two tests.
