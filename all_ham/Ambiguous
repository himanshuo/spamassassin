Title: Ambiguous Figures Task
Description: We present normative data for forty morphing picture series. In all sets line drawings of pictures of common objects morphed over 15 iterations into a completely different object. Objects either morphed from an animate to an inanimate object (or vice versa), or morphed within the animate and inanimate object categories.
