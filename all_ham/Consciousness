Title: Consciousness and retrospective cueing
Description: This project aims to investigate whether attentional cues can retrospectively modulate perception. A masking setup will be used in which words vs. non-words are briefly flashed on one side of the screen, occluded by a mask, with a subsequent cue being either conruent or ingongruent with the location of the target. Subject's task is to indicate whether the stimulus was a word or not.
