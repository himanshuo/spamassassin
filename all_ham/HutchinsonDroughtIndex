Title: HutchinsonDroughtIndex
Description: The Hutchinson Drought Index (or Drought Severity Index) is a climatic drought index 
that was designed to reflect agricultural droughts using only rainfall data.

The index was invented by Professor Mike Hutchinson at the ANU in 1992 and 
this project includes R codes written by Ivan Hanigan to describe the calculations 
and also to download data to play with.
