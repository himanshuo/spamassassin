Title: Fast Food Fiends: Social Norms of Littering
Description: Research was conducted to determine if an individual’s burden of responsibility decreases when five or more tables in a fast food restaurant are occupied. We hypothesized that people would be more likely to litter as more tables were occupied, as well as an increased number of people present. We observed and recorded the duration of each customer’s visit, the number of customers per order, and whether or not they left trash behind. There were 261 total observations. Pearson’s Point-Biserial Correlation indicated that the number of people present significantly predicted the presence of litter. A Chi-Square test indicated that the number of tables occupied was not independent of the presence of litter.  Both hypotheses were supported.
