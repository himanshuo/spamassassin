Title: Smoking topography of cannabis cigarettes varying in THC strength
Description: The primary objective of this study is to establish whether or not cannabis smokers self-titrate their exposure to THC, via modification in smoking topography, in order to achieve a consistent psychoactive effect. This will be determined observationally by examining the correlation between THC content of cigarette, and total volume of smoke inhaled per cigarette. This research question has important implications for public health and drug control policies, and is of particular current interest given evidence linking cannabis use to psychotic disorders and recent increases in market availability of stronger strains of cannabis.
