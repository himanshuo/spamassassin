Title: Asymmetric moral assessments of men, women and sub-groups of women
Description: Does social categorization influence moral assessments? Subjects responded to vignettes in which actors with gendered names or gendered traits were the victim or perpetrator of wrongdoing. Men and stereotype-incongruent women were ascribed greater responsibility (blame, punishment) for wrongdoing, while “traditional” women were ascribed greater considerability (concern, protection) as victims. [n=406 (Study 1=204; Study 2=202)]
