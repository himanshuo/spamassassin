Title: Predictive Psychology
Description: This is a proof-of-concept methodological study meant to facilitate psychology turning into a science of predicting the future (more GLM and less ESP), so the hypothesis being tested is somewhat ancillary. Nonetheless, the substantive hypothesis that will be tested is that people with cross-ethnic friends will have more cross-ethnic conflicts in their everyday life, but this effect will be fully mediated by the number of social interactions they have with outgroup members that day.
