Description: This project contains data and information relevant to a study examining publication bias in the correlations between measures of conscientiousness and job performance. The data were originally used in this publication:
Shaffer, J. A., &amp; Postlethwaite, B. E. (2012). A matter of context: A meta-analytic investigation of the relative validity of contextualized and noncontextualized personality measures. Personnel Psychology, 65, 445-493. doi: 10.1111/j.1744-6570.2012.01250.x

The data set was provided by Shaffer and Postlethwaite to Sven Kepes and Michael A. McDaniel who re-analyzed the data set for publication bias. Kepes &amp; McDaniel submitted a paper titled "The Validity of Conscientiousness is Overestimated" to PLOS One.
