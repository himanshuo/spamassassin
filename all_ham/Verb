Title: Verb aspect and bimanual coordination
Description: The following project will investigate the use of verb aspect as a guide to language comprehension. We will use a bimanual coordination task to study the time course of this comprehension process. Because verb aspect has been shown to focus a readers attention on the ongoing or completed nature of an event, we predict that it should also effect the relative phase of the bimanual coordination. Thus, this proposal makes specific predictions based on the theoretical framework of embodied cognition.
