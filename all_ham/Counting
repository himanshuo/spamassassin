Title: Counting Glacier Ice Worms
Description: Glacier ice worms live on the snowfields of Baranof Island, but they have never been formally studied here. We propose to do a population study of ice worms on selected snowfields of Baranof Island. We propose to improve existing methods for estimation the population size of glacier worms, by doing automated counting of individual worms from photographs taken in the field. We also propose to study a number of aspects related to ice worms, such as cataloging the organic matter in the snowfields that support ice worms, and tracking their motion over time.
