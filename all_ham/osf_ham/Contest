Title: Contest Study to Promote Political Civility
Description: Political partisans in the United States have become increasingly hostile toward one another, resulting in political tension and gridlock.  As such, several groups (e.g. Civil Politics, the Asteroids Club, the Village Square) have attempted to devise strategies and events to help ameliorate these problems and promote civil interactions between Republicans/conservatives and Democrats/liberals.  This study will pit various interventions aimed at reducing partisan hostility (many inspired by actions by the aforementioned groups) against one another in order to determine their relative effectiveness.
