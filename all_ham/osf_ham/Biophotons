Title: Biophotons as physical correlates of mental interaction at distance: a confirmatory study.
Description: With this pre-registered confirmatory study, we aim at demonstrating that biophotons are present during the process of producing mental interaction at a distance and that they may be the physical carriers of mental interaction (MI) at distance. Five selected participants for their experience in mental control and strong motivation for this line of research, will try to increase the number of photons detected by a photomultiplier (PMT) located approximately 7300 km far from their location using their mental intention. At a predefined time, each of them will focus mentally on the PMT for five minutes by using personalized strategies. Each of the five participants will contribute to two experimental sessions carried out in different days for a total of ten experimental sessions. Ten control sessions without mental interaction will be compared with the experimental sessions. These sessions lasting five minutes, will be recorded the same day of the experimental sessions both before and after the periods of MI separated by a time lag of 15 minutes to avoid potential carry over effects.  
As a further control that MI influences the PMT by biophotons and not by altering the functioning of its internal electronic components, within each session the participants will be asked to influence the PMT with the shutter closed. To avoid a decrease of participants’ motivation and the quality of their MI, the timing when the shutter will be open or closed, will be randomized. 
To summarize, a typical session will consist of:
30 minutes for the stabilization of the electronic components of the PMT, 5m for the control session before the MI, 15m before the MI, 5m of MI focused on the PMT, 15m post MI, 5m control session post MI, 15m between sessions, 5m control session before the second MI, 15m before the second MI, 5m of MI focused on the PMT, 15m post MI and 5m control for a total of 135m. Schematically:
30-5contr-15-5MI-15-5contr-15-5contr-15-5MI-15-5contr
As exploratory investigation we will study if the MI with the PMT will also modify the expected output of a random event generator (RNG) located close to the PMT. 

Confirmatory hypothesis: The number of photons detected by the PMT in the experimental sessions will outperform those detected in the control sessions with an expected standardized effect size of 1.5 and a raw difference of 0.3 photons x second.
Exploratory hypothesis: the minimum or the maximum deviations z values recorded from the REG outputs, will be higher during the experimental than in the control sessions.

Five selected participants will each contribute two experimental sessions lasting five minutes on two different days.
