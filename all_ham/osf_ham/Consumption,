Title: Consumption, Color, and the Delboeuf Illusion: A Perception of Portion Size and Cognitive Expressions of Hunger
Description: This study explored if external visual cues impacted how hungry subjects were before and after each manipulation. The independent variables were plate size (large or small plates) and color contrast (dark food on light plate and light food on light plate); the dependent variable was how full participants were after they consumed their portion.  I utilized chocolate and tapioca pudding cups to control the size of portions. Via this study, I aim to discover what external visual cues can maximize the perception of portion size. This information could be applied to patients who suffer from obesity and/or binge eating.
