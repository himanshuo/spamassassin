Title: Binding of auditory and visual features
Description: For visual features, automaticity of binding is affected by whether features appear to belong to the same coherent object (Ecker, Maybery, &amp; Zimmer, 2013). We investigate whether this principle also holds for cross-modal features, such as voice timbres and faces, by comparing recognition when voice-face pairs were presented as concordant versus discordant events.
