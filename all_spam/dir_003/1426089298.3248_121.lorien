<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Let me re-phrase: It starts with the chicken. Hands down, it's some of the best in the city. It's the only Nashville-style in town, true enough. (Unless you know of another place, then TELL ME.) Simple, good, down-home cooking. They've revamped the recipes a little bit as they've gone along (the slaw is less peppery and the mac has benefitted from having new, uniformly-heating ovens to cook in) and added banana pudding as a consistent dessert option.
So far, they've nailed it. From my first visit at the Near East Side Co-op (getting tickets to their previous pop-ups was the impossible dream for me), it felt like a family picnic. That's carried over to North Market. Joe is always greeting and meeting the line, working hard to remember faces and names and getting the HCT word out on the street, literally. My young niece (9) and nephew (5) think he's great ("He's the boss? He's SO NICE! I didn't know bosses were supposed to be nice!"), and Joe's genuine enjoyment shows through.
Once I'd experienced HCT (and maybe I had an out of body experience when I had my first holy dark meal), and when Joe told us the way they wanted to invest in community, I knew I'd been initiated into THE CULT OF HOT CHICKEN. It's super-fun to sit next to people who are there for the first time, and welcome them to the HCT community.
