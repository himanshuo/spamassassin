At its foot stands the Solkan Bridge spanning the Soa River.The mountain was first attested in written sources circa 1370 as Saluatin. The name is of unclear origin. Based on the oldest transcriptions of the name, it can be derived from Salbotin, based on the Latin personal name Salvus literally, 'healthy'. Another possibility assuming that the old transcriptions are wrong is that the name was originally Sabotin, based on the Italian name Sbbato, originally given to a child born on a Saturday. A third possibility is that it is derived from San Valentin there is a church dedicated to Saint Valentine on the mountain through a number of unexpected phonological changes.The mountain was first attested in written sources circa 1370 as Saluatin.
