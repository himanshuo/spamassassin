 Kindest Attention:


 I write to you in good faith and trust that you will take a moment to
 consider the contents of this letter. I am Mrs. Rachael Anderson, the
 Chief Auditor of an Assets Management Company in United Kingdom. In the
 course of my job, I discovered a floating fund in an account which was
 opened in 2009 belonging to a foreigner, who died in an air crash with
 his wife and children. All effort made to track any member of his family
 or next of kin has since failed, hence I got in contact with you to stand
 as his next of kin. He died leaving no heir or a will.

 My intention is to transfer this sum of Ten Million British Pounds
 Sterling ( 10,000,000) in the above mentioned account to a safe account
 overseas. I am therefore proposing that you partner with me and provide an
 existing account or set up a new account that will serve the purpose of
 receiving the above fund.

 For your assistance in this venture, I will give you 30% of the entire
 funds Three Million British Pounds Sterling ( 3,000,000.00).

 After going through the deceased person's records and files, I discovered
 that:


 (1) No one has operated this account since 2010
 (2) He died without an heir; hence the money has been floating
 (3) No other person knows about this account and there is no Next of Kin.


 Reply stating your full names and direct telephone number.


 Best Regards,


 Mrs. Rachael Anderson.
