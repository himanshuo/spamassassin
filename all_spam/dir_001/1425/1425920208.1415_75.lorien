Mother bear's pizza --- not your typical papa john not Pizza Hut. Born and raised in Oahu, there's no pizza joint as amazing as Mother Bear's Pizza. I don't prefer pizza and I never eat it unless there's absolutely nothing to eat. Since I was in Bloomington for a conference, we Yelped a decent 3+ star joint for dinner and we found Mother's Bear! So glad we got to come here. It was an amazing experience and the best meal I've had in Indiana. The pizza here isn't comparable to any other pizza I've had.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">I posted a photo of The Divine Swine (bacon, ham, sausage, pepperoni) on Instagram Sunday around 3:00 PM and it was as if everyone in Indiana was feeling nostalgic with me - pizza, college, and good times. They all go together, right?

Mother Bear's Pizza reminds me of my days serving up pizza and stromboli's at Maurizio's Pizza in Terre Haute. It's not about artisan ingredients and how to use as many words as you can in the title of a dish. It's about the most delicious pan pizza crust and red sauce I've ever had (and yes, I'm saying that about the pizza place I DIDN'T work at). 

They keep it fairly simple - pizza, subs, sandwiches, pasta bakes, beer, wine and soda. Known for their traditional pan and deep dish pizzas (at least that's what Yelpers say), John and I ordered a 10" Divine Swine and breadsticks with a few beers. As we sat there waiting for our pizza (which didn't take long at all), I gazed out the window to the IU School of Music and other limestone buildings. That, combined with the writings on the tables and chairs from customers in years past, reminded me of my years at Indiana State. It's not so much the pizza itself or the restaurant (though all of those things are stellar) - it's the nostalgic feeling we all get when we are reminded of good times past. 

My only complaint is that there is the smallest parking lot in the world and a lot of residential/student parking nearby that WILL tow you, so plan on parking a ways away and walking. Service was great and I really enjoyed my meal. I just can't believe it took me so long to finally get here.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
