		 Options are Tasting Menu or 3,4,5 course a la carte. I opted for 2624057 3 course a la carte. Appetizer was Risotto with Dungeness Crab, Gulf Shrimp, Shimeji Mushrooms, Roasted Tomatoes and Corn. Risotto was cooked and prepared perfectly. Texture of 2624057 Risotto was "right on" and 2624057 combination of fresh seafood made 2624057 dish fantastic. Entree was 2624057 Roasted Pork Tenderloin with Pork Belly, Carmelized Onions, Peaches, Romano Beans, and Smoked Ham Hocks. Tender Pork paired with 2624057 Pork Belly was heavenly. Just a beautiful combination of delight. Smoked Ham Hocks provided a unique pallet transformation from 2624057 Pork and Pork Belly. Quite delicious. Dessert was Strawberry Souffle with Strawberry Sauce and Strawberry Sorbet.I admit a very sweet dessert. If you have a sweet tooth like me 2624057n this dessert might be right up your alley. Strawberry Sauce is rich but not overwhelmingly rich. Extensive wine list and cocktail menu.  Something for all preferences. I opted for a Woodford Reserve Sour, actually 2, which were outstanding. Kudos to you bartender. In summary Gary Danko is San Francisco fine dining at it's finest. I was confident and justified with giving Gary Danko 4 stars, but after detailing my dining experience and reminiscing on how much I was smiling like a kid in 2624057 candy store I realized 5 stars is 2624057 accurate rating. Just a great overall experience. I would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a nice restaurant to celebrate a special occasion or family ga2624057ring. Quick useful tips. Valet is $12.00. Pay inside. You can add valet to your bill. Give server your valet slip and your car will be waiting for you outside. Reservations need to be made 2 months to 2624057 date of your desired dinner reservation. For example if you would like dinner reservations for December 1st you would need to call Gary Danko October 1st and make reservations. Same process as French Laundry. Came here for my birthday. Absolutely perfect. I love
