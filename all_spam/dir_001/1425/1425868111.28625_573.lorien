A legal representative and personal attorney to my client business magnate. Actually, I got your contact information through your country records while searching for a last name similar to my late client's who was a business magnate that lived in Spain for over a decade prior to his death, he died along with his nuclear family during the Tsunami catastrophe.</FONT><BR>

<FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman">Prior to my explaining further, I must first apologize for this unsolicited mail to you. I am aware that this is certainly not a predictable way of approach to foster a relationship of trust, but because of the circumstances and the urgency surrounding this claim. I decided to reach you via this media to join me to put claims on this fund before it is seized or confiscated by the authorities.Prior to the catastrophe; He deposited the sum of $7.4M (SEVEN MILLION, FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS) with his bank here in Spain. As the Attorney/Adviser to my late client and family, the bank has officially notified and instructed me to present heir/inheritor to make Claims, so that he/she can be paid the outstanding $7.4M, else the fund will be confiscated and taken to the Bureau of government treasury as unclaimed.</FONT><BR>

<FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman">Ensuing to the above I embarked on exhaustive search for a direct family member to my late client which came to no avail. I was given an ultimatum to look for some relative to come for the claim or have the fund liquidated and made unserviceable in accordance with existing laws. After preliminary efforts of search for a direct family member which came to no avail, I decided to contact you; my suggestion to you is that I will like to present you as the heir/inheritor to this deposited fund). I know you may not be anyway related to my late client but having a common surname with him it is absolutely necessary for me to make it take the resemblance of an actual next of kin; this is where I need your assistance, although I know that a transaction of this magnitude might make anyone apprehensive but I would like to assure you that I am proposing this project to you with the best of intention as an attorney.</FONT><BR>
