Hello,

Pardon me if I invaded your privacy. My names are Kiyohiro Mitsui, a Japan citizen, the officer in charge of procurement 
management section of United Nations.. However I understand the insecure nature of soliciting for business on the internet, 
unfortunately I have no other option than to search for credible foreign collaboration to partner with me in the actualization of a 
viable and profitable United Nations Financed Project. During my auditing, I discovered an over invoiced amount of ( Huge Amount). 
The company that executed this contract Rycon Distributors Liverpool, United Kingdom have been
paid in full as I recently confirmed leaving this amount floating.

All arrangements will be made under a legitimate framework. The transaction is 100% risk free .
Full details will be disclosed to you on your expression of interest
I look forward to doing good business with you.
Warmest Regards

Kiyohiro Mitsui
OIC- United Nations
