I am Captain Robert Hector Perez a combat instructor and  battalions 
commander of the 82nd Airborne Division's,1-504th PIR,Division in the 
American army presently in Kandahar Afghanistan where am stationed...
Early November last year,my team and i were sent on an assignment to 
trace the Taliban's hide out at the south central area of Kandahar and 
we traveled for over 4 hours to locate this hide out that was shaded by 
the hill and we eventually ran into them on aware and we release fire on 
some of them and caught some and few were able to take an unknown root 
and ran off.
On our search on the hide out we discovered sophisticated weapon's like 
AK-47,Lee Enfeild Rifles,SVD-Dragunov Sniper Rifles,RPG-7,RPK Machine 
Guns as well as a few Stinger Rocket Launchers and have been smuggled in 
from Iran from our investigations, we also saw a map of their location 
of where there were planning to explode and 4 bags filled with US 
Dollars and it was about $2.5 million dollar's each on the bags making 
it $10 million dollars.

After our raiding there was done,Captain Kenneth Buff my colleague and 
myself agree that some part of this money should be shared between us on 
the mission before informing anybody about it since both of us were the 
senior officers in the team,$3,000 000{Three Million Dollars} was given 
to me as my own share, but I tell you what! No compensation can make up 
for the risk we have taken with our lives. So I'm seeking your kind 
assistance to move the sum of {USD$3M} to you through a diplomatic 
delivery service and that will be done in a close by country 
Pakistan,but you are going to assure me first of all that my share of 
{70 Percent} will be safe in your care until I complete my service here 
in Afghanistan while you have your {30 Percent} to spend,Please write me 
back to my personal Email [capt.robert.perez@gmail.com]if you are 
interested and also be noted that this is a confidential business and 
nobody most know about this.
