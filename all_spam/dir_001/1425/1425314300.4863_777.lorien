I came here with with my boyfriend and 4 friends last month for my birthday and i must say, it was one of the best meals i have ever had! 

The place was bumpin when we got there, full to the door on a Sunday evening, which for me is not a bad thing, but a great sign and made my group that much more excited. The staff was great throughout the whole experience. They were very accommodating on the phone when adjusting our reservation and polite during the wait when we arrived. Our server was very knowledgeable and attentive. Knowing it was a bday, she was thoughtful enough to leave the drink menu on the table ;), she informed us of all the specials (of which there are many given that everything is so fresh!) and our friend chose to start with chicharrons. It arrived promptly at the table, piping hot from the fryer and still crackling with a side of Parmesan foam. The highlight would have to be the cheese foam, because none of my party had tried anything like it and it was very exciting to our taste buds. We were all very happy with our entrees, I had the cod on chorizo lentils, and it blew my mind.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
