Attn:

I am Rev, Chris Puller and I am a new worker with the Nigeria Airport Authorities. As I was cleaning my new office today, I discovered a brown envelop as I opened it I discovered it was a Certified Bank Check that was inside the envelop and the Check with all legal documents backing the funds and your name was on it including your email address, it was a donation to you. That is why am contacting you through mail.


I don't know why you did not claim your money then, the check is valued ($1.5USD) One Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars.But,I am willing to help you do what is required so you can claim your money. The only thing you have to pay for now is the Administrating fee for me to register your parcel to avoid issues with the authorities here. Which is ($220) only, as I am going help you put your parcel in the next available flight coming to your country.There is a way I intend to send you your Funds and you will not any other fee such as Insurance or delivery fee, I just need $220 to register the parcel that it as left Nigeria, I will then speak to any delivery officer coming to your country to deliver your parcel when you have the parcel you can then pay the delivery officer at your door post. But you have to pay the Administration fee which is $220 before I can carry out this plan.


If you agree to this please write me back asap,so I will tell you what to do. And you will get this money in 3days time.Kindly re-confirm your details to clarify I communicating with the right person:

Full name :
Sex:
Your Current Address & Country:
Telephone:

I await your response, my name is Mr ,Chris Puller and my direct number is +2347057153600.

Please note: This information I just disclosed should be confidential and you are to be discrete as to save my job and life. Also note that your CERTIFIED BANK DRAFT (CHECK) AND ALL YOUR LEGAL DOCUMENTS backing your FUND is in the envelop. I shall be sending all to you if you comply to my directives. I am doing you a favor please don't ask me to send parcel with my own money it wont work that way.

Thanks and God bless you.
Yours sincerely,
Rev, Chris Puller.
