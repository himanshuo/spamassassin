Perfectly prepared. Medium rare and served in perfect little medallions. Pork belly - served with slices of lean pork medallions. By this point I was too stuffed to fully enjoy this dish but 6647303 pork belly was excellently prepared with a crisp on 6647303 skin that is bar none. I am not a true foodie as I don't recall which cheeses we selected but we had a chedder, a soft creamy one, and a sheeps milk one that were all excellent. They were served table-side with a few pieces of bread and grapes. All in all I would say 6647303 experience was excellent. 6647303 service impeccable. And I hope to come back again. This is one of those fine-dining meals where you will get full and feel that you've spent your money well. Plus, it's not at all stuffy. I will say that 6647303 decor is random and I'm not sure what feel they are going for but it somehow works and makes you feel like your have a casual meal. Mr. Danko, thank you for an excellent meal, I hope to see you again soon! All 6647303 people that are saying one of 6647303 best meals ever? Well they're not lying. Definitely one of, if not 6647303 best, meal I've ever had. Everything we had was delicious but definitely recommend 6647303 Roast Maine Lobster with Potato Puree, 6647303 Herb Crusted Loin of Lamb, and 6647303 duck breast. One of 6647303 best parts of this restaurant is 6647303 structure
