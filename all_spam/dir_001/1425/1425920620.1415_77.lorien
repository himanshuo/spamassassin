<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">This place is larger and busier than we expected. There are numerous separate dining rooms, which are each charming but to access some you need to walk through another dining room, creating a strange traffic pattern and disrupting intimacy. Plus guests interested in the bldg's history (and there were many) tend to wander around  checking out the different dining rooms, adding to the bustling atmosphere. 

Had a more casual vibe than we anticipated,  with people dressed in everything from  worn jeans and sneakers or flip flops to people dressed for their special night out in  suits and dresses.    I usually like it when there is a range of different dress styles, but this was a little odd, flip flop wearing patron seated at table next to someone in business suit and tie. . . 

On to the food.  The entrees were wonderful, unfortunately everything else was only mediocre. The signature pink lady cocktail (raspberry vodka and lemonade) was super sweet with no lemon flavor or tartness. I couldn't finish it. The appetizer, blackened oysters, had almost no discernible oyster flavor. The kitchen did not detach oysters fully from shell so we could not dislodge oyster in one piece. Much of the oyster remained attached to shell. Blackened spice and relish/chutney toppings overwhelmed the pieces of oyster that we could remove from the shell. The toppings did not compliment the briny flavor of the oyster, just smothered it.  DH said he had one with no oyster at all, it stayed attached to shell.  

Entrees were the highlight.  Red snapper special and signature scored crispy flounder were both outstanding, fresh and perfectly cooked; but side dishes were not memorable -  collard greens were very salty, rice with beans were fine but not outstanding.  

Service was really excellent, very accommodating, even tho the restaurant was packed staff never made us feel rushed, and were friendly and professional.

It is too bad the sides and cocktail did not met the high standard set by the entrees and the service.  If they had,  this would be a 4 or 5 star review.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
