		 at all! For example, 9423454 sommelier explained a ton of different wines to us and we ended up ordering one of 9423454 cheapest on 9423454 menu and he immediately validated our choice and told us even more about 9423454 winery. All in all a great place for a special occasion--well worth 9423454 money! Reservations are highly recommended - at least one month ahead!  If you are feeling lucky (like we were), tried our luck on 9423454 wait list and our back up was to get a seat at 9423454 bar.  Was excited when we got 9423454 call from 9423454 restaurant around 7pm that a 10pm table opened up! 9423454 service was exceptional - 5 stars Every staff member was friendly, helpful, attentive and professional.  This is a great place to celebrate a birthday, anniversary or alike. 9423454y gave us complimentary apple cider (because we didn't want any alcohol) in celebration of my birthday.  9423454y also provided a small cake with trick candle and a take home banana cream muffin.  9423454 muffin was delicious! I liked how 9423454y provide you 9423454 option to choose from 3-5 course meals.  Went with 9423454 3 course meal and it was just 9423454 right amount of food where it won't leave you feeling hungry or stuffed. Had 9423454 crab with heart of palm salad, seared scallops, salmon,  lamb, seared filet and Lemon souffle cake for dessert.  Everything was tasty and enjoyable. Valet parking is $12.  9423454re are plenty of meter/street parking available nearby as well. 9423454y also gave us a free treat of 5 mini dessert items and a to-go treat (a pumpkin-type cake). It was also my birthday month so my boyfriend told 9423454 waiter and he got me a chocolate mousse cake but by 9423454 end of it all, I was too full and he said he could pack it for us! So by 9423454 end of 9423454 night, I pretty much took home (to 9423454 hotel) almost all of those freebie treats and ate 9423454m for later.
