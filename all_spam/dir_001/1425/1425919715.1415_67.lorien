Let's be real though, no restaurant wins on looks alone. Q39 was bomb BBQ, and I can see why they've won so many competitions. We shared the spiced onion straws to start, and they were a great twist on typical onion rings (plus the dip was fantastic). For our meals, the guys both ordered the award-winning "No Jackin' Around" and I had the Firebird Chicken. We were all thoroughly impressed with our choices, and I cannot wait to try more in future visits to come.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Let me begin by saying I ended up at Q39 by mistake, and it was a great mistake to have made. I was passing through Kansas City and wanted to sample some of its famous BBQ and for most places needed to get there before 10pm. Unfortunately I didn't make it until after so I heard a recommendation for Q39 and went for it.

My preference when it comes to 'cue is dry rubbed and heavily smoked, and that isn't what this place had. Their meats weren't even what I was looking for and it was STILL delicious. Everything is smoked but it's then sauced, and it was good. I ordered a 1/2 rack of ribs with a side sampler of brisket, sides were the fries and the baked beans.

Everything was delicious. The rib meat wasn't falling off the bone but would gently release its grab with a soft pull revealing a firm but tender meat. It was excellent texture for ribs. The flavor was outstanding. The brisket also maintained that perfect blend of firmness and tenderness making it a true pleasure to eat. Both meats came sauced, and their sauce pairings were spot-on.

Here's where Q39 absolutely popped for me: If you have the option to sit at the bar when Danny is working, do it. This gentleman is one of the best bartenders I've ever been served by. Service like his is hard to come by and was quite unexpected in a barbecue joint. Upon his recommendation he served me a cocktail called a Templeton Smoked and Sour (see picture). It was a whiskey sour infused with wood smoke! I assume the smoke was hickory based on smell, and it was INCREDIBLE. I was so impressed with Danny's service and the restaurant that I called over the manager to tell him (and he was a great guy, too).

This place is a solid 4.5 star joint but has earned a 5-star review due to service. I don't care for my meat to be pre-sauced and I prefer a more dry and smokey rib but it doesn't matter at Q39. Top to bottom this place was great.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
