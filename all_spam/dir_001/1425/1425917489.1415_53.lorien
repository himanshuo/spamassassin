The sides were a home run with the BBQ baked black beans. I've never seen this with black beans which are my favorite bean. There was a nice hit of heat, some red peppers and little chunks of pork. So. Good. The pepper biscuit was also very good. The stinker of the plate was the coleslaw. I found the cabbage to be cut too thick for my taste and not enough mayo and/or seasoning. On a health side it's probably better for you the way they serve it but compromises on being memorable coleslaw.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

My husband and myself are proud supporters of this place and the owner Dave. He takes so much pride in the quality and integrity of food. 

Speaking of food... What amazing flavors and savory dishes. Some people may give the place a lower rating because Dave can sell out of items throughout the day and you might get a night when its slim pick'ns. But come on look at it this way there are just so many people racing to get this amazing food. He is just one man cook'n his heart out. We are multitides racing every day to have some of the great food. Just get there earlier and faster than everyone else and you're golden. 

Try the meat loaf its my favorite. More on the sweet side but still really savory. My husband enjoys the thick protein and less sweet brisket. Burnt ends and pulled pork are great choices for kids with a side of mac-n-cheese.

Dave has also put a twist on some traditional dishes I wouldn't normally eat. His version I just love. Rosta Corn, Chicken Gumbo just amazing sides with a chocolate pie.

Just remember if its your first time the race is on so get there early so you can have a full menu to taste.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
