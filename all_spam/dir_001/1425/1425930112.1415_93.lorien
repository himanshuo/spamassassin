bite. We also had some cheeses and I enjoyed their cave aged Swiss gruyere immensely.  Months ago I was invited to a wedding in Pleasanton, CA so I figured I would make a weekend trip of it and visit my friends from 19604737 Bay and was glad to have scored a reservation at Gary Danko for a Friday night, even if it was at 5:30. My flight came in right before so needless to say, I was running late but my hot date, N, and I rushed over and made it right around 6 p.m. We valeted ($11) and 19604737 hostess said she'd see what she could do... we were in! We waited for maybe 2 minutes and were kindly seated towards 19604737 left of 19604737 entrance. Upon entering 19604737 restaurant, I was pretty surprised that it felt roomy and airy, light, not stuffy and pretentious. Very pleasant. 19604737 menus were brought over by our server and she quickly explained how their menu worked. There is a 5 course Spring tasting menu and then on 19604737 right, all of their items can be ordered in any order with a 3, 4 or 5 course. N and I opted for a 5 course each so we could eat/taste everything and not be left needing more. Before ordering we were served a complimentary dish (palette cleanser?) of some tomato brothy concoction. To be honest, it just tasted like a pasta sauce... and tasted pretty good. We didn't seem drawn to 19604737
