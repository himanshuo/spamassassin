It can also be used to restore eyelashes, eyebrows, upletters:5: NEHVAbeard hair, chest hair, pubic hair and to fill in scars caused by accidents or surgery such as face-lifts and previous hair transplants.

As transplanted hair will only grow in its new site for as long as it would have in its original one, these parameters continue to serve as the fundamental foundation for hair follicle harvesting, whether by strip method or FUE. For the next twenty years, surgeons worked on transplanting smaller grafts, but results were only minimally successful, with 2â€“4 mm "plugs" leading to a doll's head-like appearance.
