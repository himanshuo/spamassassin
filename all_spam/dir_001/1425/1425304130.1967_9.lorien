It was too loud to carry on a conversation, too many tables packed into a tiny space and it was hotter than hell up there (it was February!). Our server was not the usual attentive you get at Mastros, it was probably too hard for him to get to our table. He also forgot our appetizer (he did comp it when he brought it out later). The food was incredible, redeeming the evening. Martini was awesome. But we wanted the Mastro's experience - you pay for the excellent service and it simply was not there.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Every time I come to LA, I always plan on fine dining just once during my stay. This weekend I chose Mastro's and it did not disappoint. 

Everything is what I imagined with a little twist here and there. This is truly a steakhouse penthouse; there is a mini bar downstairs with a check-in line for guest. As you check-in, you are led to this red carpet swirl-staircase. The atmosphere changes to a dark room with specs of dim light. Live jazz music is played in the background with a woman singing. 

The level of sophistication is a five here. People are dressed to impress, service is on point with their clean white blazers and black bow ties, etc. Our guy Brandon form last night gave his introduction on the quality/story of Mastro's steaks. It was short, brief, and full on important info for us to know. 

Since we ordered wine (12' Mondavi, Cabernet Sauvignon), Brandon introduced the bottle and poured a splash into the wine glass for me to taste. He made sure I was fine with it before pouring the glasses. This was well presented to my table and it was an ideal pair to our steaks.

I ordered Mastro's signature "Chef Cut" - 33 oz. Ribeye. The meat was thick and cooked to medium rare plus which had a cool inner layer. The steak was cooked to perfection with its lightly char top, buttery cuts, tender and moist texture, and the hot plate that keeps the steak sizzlin'. I usually like my steak rubbed with horseradish cream and a light touch of A1. This level up steak eating is something everyone should try. Their steaks are top of the line and are chosen carefully and specifically for it's guests. Only the best is what it is here.
Mastro's gave me a great experience of how steak should be eaten. Its a special feeling when you dine with a group of people you love on top of a balcony in the middle Rodeo Drive, 5-star service and food that will keep you wanting more.

I will def be coming back! This is the best steak house in LA. period.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
