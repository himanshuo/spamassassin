capital at the beginning consists of the piece of leather, the thread, etc. As my labor goes on, value is steadily added, until, when my labor results  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
in the finished shoes, I have my capital plus the difference in value between the material and the shoes. In obtaining this additional value—my  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 </p>

<p align="left"<i>style="font: 16px;">wages—how is capital at any KTWPWBTN time drawn upon? Adam Smith, who f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 gave the direction to PNNDOWXVK economic thought that has resulted f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 in the current elaborate theories of the relation between wages</i>and capital, 
recognized the fact that f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 in such simple cases as I have instanced, WKF wages are the produce of labor, and thus begins his chapter upon the wages of </p>
<BR><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Courier New, Times New Roman, Arial; font-size: 8px; color: #ffffff;"></span>
<p align="left" style="font: 15px;">labor (Chap. VIII): ”The produce of labor constitutes the natural recompense or wages<b>of labor. In that original</b>f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 state of f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 things which precedes both the appropriation of 
land and the accumulation of stock, the whole produce OVCPBUHDY of WNKSMC labor belongs to the laborer. He has neither landlord nor master to share with him.“ </p>

<p>Had the great f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 Scotchman taken this as the initial point of his reasoning, and continued to f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 regard the produce of labor as the natural wages of labor, 
and the<I>landlord and master but as RQVHIJW sharers, his conclusions would have been very different,</I>and political economy to-day would NBTLWGJIL not embrace such a mhi 
of contradictions and absurdities; but instead of following the truth obvious in the XGOPJLYMM simple modes f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 of production as a clew through the perplexities of the more complicated forms, f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 he momentarily recognizes it,

It is LIXUQ evident that in thus placing f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 the proportion of self-employing workmen

independent laborers who in every community exist in considerable numbers, the agriculture of large districts of Europe has, since the time of the  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
Roman Empire, been carried on by the metayer system, under which the capitalist receives his f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 return from the laborer instead of the laborer from
