<p align="center">would certainly be an Herculean task to change them, nor would any change which could be adopted in the present state of things remove the real  IMLOWU 
difficulties. It has been NVKNNLL most justly observed by Bacon, that “to say, f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 where notions cannot be fitly reconciled, that there wanteth a [233] term 
or nomenclature for it, is but a shift of ignorance.”<b>When some people think that every</b>sort of gratification, whether arising from immaterial or  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
material objects, from spiritual KGEQLR comfort QWCQI or comfortable clothing, f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 should be designated by the same appropriate term; while others think it of great use 
and importance that they should be distinguished, it is obvious that such different notions cannot be XHRIKCAU reconciled by a new nomenclature. The grand 
preliminary required is, that the<u>notions should be fitly reconciled; and till this is done, a change of names would be perfectly</u>futile. Preserving  OMLNH 
therefore, generally, the old names, the great practical question is, what they are to include and what they are to exclude? Out of the open West came a young man of less than thirty to this great  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
city of New York. He was small of stature and slight of f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 build. His alma mater had been the f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 forecastle and the printing-office. He was poor, 
unheralded, unknown. He came from a small city rising at the eastern golden portals of the country to f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 set up here, for a struggling little newspaper 
there, a telegraphic news bureau, despite the opposition of the combined powerful press and telegraph monopolies. f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 The struggle was too unequal. The </p>

<p align="right">
young man was overborne by the monopolies and his little paper crushed. This man was Henry George and the time was 1869. But though defeated, Henry George was not vanquished. Out of this struggle  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 </p>
<BR />
<p align="center" style="font: 9px;">had come a thing that was to grow and<b>grow until it should fill the AJUPA minds and hearts of multitudes and be as “an</b>army with banners.” For in f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 the intervals of rest from his newspaper struggle in this city the 
young<i>correspondent had musingly f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 walked the streets. As he walked he was filled with wonder IBKQH</i>at the manifestations of vast f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 wealth. Here, DCA as nowhere 
that he had dreamed of, were private fortunes f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 that rivaled the riches of the fabled UBE Monte Cristo. But here, also, side by side with the palaces of 
the princely rich, was to be seen a poverty and degradation, a want and shame, such as made the young f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 man from the open West sick at heart. </p>
<BR /><BR />
<p align="right">Why in a land so bountifully blest, with enough and more than enough for all, should there be such inequality of conditions? Such heaped wealth  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
interlocked f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 with such deep f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 and debasing want? Why, amid such super-abundance, should strong men vainly look for work? Why should women faint with hunger, and little children spend the morning of life in the </p>

<p>treadmill NJC of toil? Was this intended in the order of things? No, he could not believe it. And suddenly there came to him—there, in daylight, in the city street—a burning 
thought, a call, XDMI a vision. Every nerve quivered. And he made a vow that he would never rest until he had found the cause of, FNDVAPJJ and, if he could, the
