Highlights include the scallops and risotto, the jumbo prawns, the parmesan spatzle, and the bacon doughnuts. Everything was very rich and heavy.. but also great portions. I didn't love the strawberry glazed ribs but my boyfriend enjoyed the dish. I also felt the broccoli rabe dish was super creamy and slightly too rich. Maybe it was because we had it so late in the meal so we were already quite full at that point.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">What good Jew wouldn't be lured to a place called Traif?  For those of you not in the know, "traif" in Yiddish means foods that aren't Kosher.  So, you say to yourself, then why would an observant Jew come to this place?  Well, an observant Jew most likely wouldn't, but while Jewish, I'm not that observant, and I happen to be lured here by the many, many outstanding reviews for this place....... and being a foodie that resides in Los Angeles, well, I just had to give this place a try when visiting NYC.  I've had my eye on this place for at least a couple of years.

Well, now having dined here, it reminded me of that scene in the movie, Chocolat, where Vianne had prepared this amazing birthday dinner feast.  I remember watching her guests as their eyes continuously rolled to the backs of their heads in utter gastronomic bliss.  That's how I felt here.  Every dish was sublime, such unique and wonderful flavors dancing on my tongue, and yes, my eyes would roll to the back of my head with each taste I took.  It was amazing, and I didn't want it to end.

What was interesting to me was that I don't normally eat some of the foods that I ate.... like pork belly.  (Did you just gasp?)  No, not because I'm Jewish, but more because I don't like it.  (Okay, I heard you gasp that time.)  But I tried it because if ever I'm going to like it, it'd be here.  While I can safely say it wasn't my favorite dish, I'm still glad I tried it.  As for the list of dishes we dined on, I'll be happy to tell you what we ate, but then, the menu WHEN you decide to go will most likely be different.  It changes frequently, and quite honestly, that's a very cool thing.  To me, it speaks to the chefs' creativity and versatility.  I'm still blown away by the unique combinations of ingredients, herbs, spices, everything.

The dishes are on a par with "small plates," but because of the richness of each dish, you will only want small portions, and yet, you will still get full.  Three of us devoured 9 very unique dishes.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
