xx-small;">I&rsquo;m interested in getting a walk-in bathtub for my wife th=
at&rsquo;s easy for her to get in and out of. Can you offer any consumer ti=
ps?A walk-in bathtub is a great option for seniors with mobility problems w=
ho have trouble getting in and out of a traditional tub. But with so many o=
ptions available, choosing one can be challenging.Walk-in bathtubs are spec=
ialty products that have a watertight, hinged door built into the side of t=
he tub that provides a much lower threshold to step over (usually 3 to 7 in=
ches) versus a standard tub that&rsquo;s around 15 inches.In addition to th=
e low threshold, most walk-in tubs =EF=BB=BFhave a built-in seat, grab bars=
, anti-slip floors and a handheld shower head. And many higher-end models o=
ffer therapeutic spalike features that are great for seniors with arthritis=
 and other ailments.I heard that white kidney beans extract helps to delay =
digestion and absorption of carbohydrates which result in loosing weight. I=
n my opinion, in general beans are fillers which make you feeling full yet =
it has very high calories. I think it is some brilliant entrepreneur ideas =
to making it rich on weight loss. In any case, I prefer the real thing with=
out replacing or substitute with chemicals etc. The only time I use white k=
idney beans is making a Chinese pork rib stew with some preserved mustard g=
reen and you guessed right, nobody wanted to eat it. Then I don&#39;t cook =
anymore white or red kidney beans because of its high protein content, high=
 calories and also time consuming. We still have the red kidney beans soup =
as dessert, end of Chinese dinner in the restaurant, or some asian cakes (C=
hinese and Japanese cakes like mochi, chi chi (sesame ball) baked bread and=
 buns) with red kidney beans paste. One thing proven is by eating red or wh=
ite kidney beans in paste, soup but not extract, during pregnancy, will giv=
e the baby a very good skin and smooth complexion which my children can sho=
wcase and vouch for itUltimately, The way I understand low carb diets to wo=
rk so well at losing fat is this: When carbs are not used through exercise =
or normal body functions, they convert to fat. Also carbs like simple sugar=
s spike insulin levels which just converts everything to fat. So what decre=
asing your carb intake significantly does is one, make sure that your not t=
aking in excess fat. And more importantly 2, forces your body to use fat an=
d possibly protein as primary energy sources. So by having to use fat, it i=
ncreases oxidation of fats in your body, and therefore, burns straight up f=
at. But be aware that your body does need some level of carbs to keep worki=
ng. Also much of the weight you lose while on a low carb diet can be easily=
 gained back after you start eating carbs again. So the best plan is to dec=
rease your carb intake when possible, make a diet you can LIVE with, not ju=
st something to lose a few pounds only to gain them backI&#39;ve heard that=
 it helps you to lose weight faster, but the problem is then keeping the we=
ight off. At least 45% of the calories you take in every day should come fr=
om carbs, making a low-carb diet really unhealthy, and once you begin to ea=
t carbs again it becomes really hard to keep the weight off because it alte=
rs your metabolism.You are so smart my friend, so smart that you want other=
s to believe what you think. There are many like you on earth and you will =
certainly have company in Hell someday when the likes of you are gone. With=
out God, only evil will exist and you are one of its product. A pity really=
 because you are using your God given intellect to urge others to join the =
Legions of others like you. Why look so bad at Religion when it teaches onl=
y goodness and love to all. Would you rather have a world that offers nothi=
ng but hate towards your fellowmen ?Are you a person who do not have friend=
s around you everyday? Do you hate people when they do not show their love =
to you. You are not so smart then my friend&quot;, try and greet all with a=
 smile and maybe a hug...then you will be rewarded with joy and gladness wh=
erever you go. Although this may not sound all that bad, a high-protein, lo=
w-carb diet also comes with a lot of health risks. When you cut out carbs a=
nd take in a lot of protein, you put your body at risk for things like oste=
oporosis, high cholesterol, and ketosis. Ketosis is a dangerous metabolic s=
tate that mimics diabetes in a sense, and can cause organs to fail and resu=
lt in gout, kidney stones and even kidney failure. You need to consume at l=
east 100 grams of carbs a day to prevent Ketosis.it can help, but the only =
reason it works is because you are cutting calories by doing this, if you c=
ut any other food group out and didnt replace it, you would also loose weig=
ht.There are theories that carbs can make you gain weight but its only if y=
ou consume too much of them. Many carbs are made from refined foods such as=
 white bread, crisps, white pasta, cakes, scones etc which will all raise y=
our blood sugar very quickly, then have it plummet very quickly, this will =
make you feel hungry as it drops. So you eat more- and its this eating more=
 that will make you put on weight.You CAN eat carbs and loose weight, but i=
t would be more helpful for you to eat non refined stuff such as brown rice=
, multigrain bread (not brown bread, brown bread is just white bread which =
has been dyed), whole grain pasta and staying away from sugary stuff. This =
will mean your blood sugar isnt rising as quickly, your body has more work =
to do, and you are less likely to have a massive sugar drop 20 mins later.P=
rotein can also help- eat it with the carbs, it will help your body regeste=

; or go into &quot;remission&quot;. I believe that what that is is decreasi=
ng the need to take medications. A person who has diabetes will always have=
 it... but there are cases where a type can either reduce medications or ev=

if you can find a part time job while in school at any type of restaurant (=

 diseases most people have never heard of&hellip;in fact, upwards of 20 mil=
lion Americans have it.Peripheral neuropathy is caused by damage to your bo=
dy&rsquo;s peripheral nerves.This damage disrupts the body&rsquo;s ability =
to communicate with its muscles, skin, joints, or internal organs. It is li=
ke the body&rsquo;s wiring system breaking down. If ignored, neuropathy can=
 lead to numbness, pain, weakness and incoordination. However, if it is dia=
gnosed and treated early, peripheral neuropathy can often be controlled, sl=
owing the disease&rsquo;s progression.Peripheral neuropathy is a term used =
to describe disorders of your peripheral nervous system. Your peripheral ne=
rvous system includes nerves in your face, arms, legs, torso, and some nerv=
es in your skull. In fact, all of your nerves not located in your central n=
ervous system &mdash; which includes the brain and the spinal cord &mdash; =
are peripheral nerves.Neuropathies may affect just one nerve (mononeuropath=
y) or several nerves (polyneuropathy). Your nerves provide communication be=
tween your brain and your muscles, skin, internal organs and blood vessels.=
 When damaged, your nerves can&#39;t communicate properly, and that miscomm=
unication causes symptoms such as painnumbness.Peripheral neuropathy often =
affects people with diabetes and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid art=
hritis and lupus. Certain vitamin deficiencies, some medications and alcoho=
lism can also damage peripheral nerves.Treating the underlying condition ma=
y relieve some cases of peripheral neuropathy. In other cases, treatment of=
 peripheral neuropathy may focus on managing pain. Peripheral nerves have a=
 remarkable ability to regenerate themselves, and new treatments for periph=
eral neuropathy using nerve growth factors or gene therapy may offer even b=
etter chances for recovery in the future. </span></span></b></p>=0D
