The industry was originally described in 1909 by the French scholar Pallary, at the site of Abri Mouillah. Other names for the industry have included "Mouillian" and "Oranian".Recent fieldwork indicates that the culture existed in the region from around the timing of the Last Glacial Maximum LGM, at 20,000 BP, until the Younger Dryas.
