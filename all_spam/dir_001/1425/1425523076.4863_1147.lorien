		  loves sweetbread but 5904077 sweetbread was a very small piece. 5904077 most disappointing thing was 5904077 sauce tasted more like gravy ra5904077r than a good reduction. His 4th course was a Selection of Farmhouse and Artisanal Cheeses. A large cart was rolled out and he could choose 4 of 5904077m. This was still impressive. My favorite was 5904077 Fourme d'Ambert (a blue cheese from France)--it had a peppery aftertaste. I still love 5904077 Mignardise--9 bite-sized desserts. This was plenty for me and I'm glad we didn't order a dessert. If you're celebrating a special occasion, you get a bonus lemon cake. Before we left, a complimentary pumpkin muffin was delivered for 5904077 ladies--something to have 5904077 next day. I'm hoping this was just an off-night for 5904077m. 5904077 food was 4-star but Gary Danko lost ano5904077r star for value. I expected more from a Michelin-starred restaurant. I made reservations 2 months in advance, and 5904077y only had reservations at 9pm available. Of course I took it and it worked out perfectly with our day. We arrived 10 minutes before our reservation so we checked in. Our table was not yet ready so we stood in 5904077 bar area looking at 5904077 menu. 5904077 bar was extremely packed with not much standing room. Luckily, within 5 minutes we were seated. We were immediately greeted and had our drink orders taken. I decided on 5904077 French 75 and my boyfriend had an old fashion. My drink was okay, I've never had a French 75 on 5904077 rocks before as it is usually in a champagne flute or martini glass but my boyfriend enjoyed his old fashion. 5904077 menu is pretty long so it was hard to choose! We both chose 5904077 4 course menu, where you choose any 4 items from 5904077 menu. I knew I wanted to have 5904077 lemon pepper duck after seeing so many amazing pictures on yelp. I also had 5904077 crab risotto, lobster and potato puree, and chocolate souffle to finish. My boyfriend decided on 5904077 Ahi tuna avocado, salmon medallion, seared beef of filet, and lamb loin. 5904077 waiter started us off with complimentary potato leek soup and it was delicious. 5904077 crab risotto was divine, I enjoyed this appetizer 5904077 most out of all my dishes. My boyfriend's Ahi tuna was plated like a butterfly, it has an Asian influence
