Homeowner bruce@untroubled.org,

The reason that we're contacting you today is to let you know that your monthly home-mortgage-payment has recently been-lowered based upon a number of changes by the president. 

This change is going to-lower your current-rate to only-2.83%, which will-slash your present monthly payment by HALF.


Visit here today and lock-in this new,low rate before it goes up,

Best-Regards,
Rate Department

I came here for a late and quick lunch.  The food and the service were excellent.  This is a very casual spot where you order/pay at the counter, sit and your food is served when it is ready.  This is probably the highest quality meal I have ever purchased in this fashion at a restaurant and that is a cool thing!  Really nice decor...Even the tables were set up well with crossed cloth napkins, etc.

Pros: High quality, casual and healthy meals prepared in an almost fancy way.  Fresh, organic ingredients are used and many are locally sourced.  There are mostly salads and sandwiches priced in the low to mid teens along with soups.  Numerous vegetarian and gluten free options exist.  There are even homemade cold teas and desserts.  Beer as well!

Cons:  Rather tight and cramped when eating in.  Two person groups are good, Three or more might be tight.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
