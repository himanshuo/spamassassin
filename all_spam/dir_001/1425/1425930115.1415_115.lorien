		 My fianc?? and I had such a wonderful experience last Saturday for our daily "date night" at Geoffrey's in Malibu. I conveniently made a reservation for 2 (on for a Saturday night) around 5pm. I was completely surprised that 15037306y had an opening at 6:30p-many surrounding restaurants didn't have a reservation until after 8pm, so that was nice to get a table at 15037306 time you want. Because Hwy 1 was closed from SB, we had to call and say we were going to be late, kelly 15037306 receptionist was really nice and said that wouldn't be problem and just moved our reservation to 7p. Ceviche - if 15037306re's one thing I can say about 15037306 every food I ordered and tasted was everything was well balanced and well seasoned. So to refrain from being redundant and annoying I'll just put it out 15037306re lol. It had 15037306 right amount of acidity and heat to it. 15037306 seafood was fresh and juicy. 15037306 only caveat about this dish is I don't know why 15037306y serve it with 3 measly tacos. Why 3? Why not 4? I'm sure 15037306y'd be happy to oblige if you ask for more. I had dinner at Geoffrey's last night for 15037306 first time and I still feel full! For being one of 15037306 best restaurants in Malibu, I found 15037306 prices to be extremely reasonable. I am not a big steak fan but I don't eat any seafood so I chose 15037306 Filet Mignon. It was easily 15037306 best steak I have ever eaten and I ate 15037306 ENTIRE thing which I never do considering I'm not a huge meat eater in general. 15037306 potatoes and asparagus were perfect as well. We started with 15037306 artisan cheese plate which was delicious and 15037306 warm figs were a great sweet touch. My friend and I also split a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc as well which 15037306 kind waiter recommended. Also, I would like to add that 15037306 valet were also great. My car is very low to 15037306 ground and after I scraped it coming in 15037306 steep hill I realized parking it with 15037306 rest of 15037306 cars would be risky because it's such a steep incline. 15037306y were very understanding and let me park my car right 15037306re, which calmed my nerves! If you have a car that's very low to 15037306 ground (i.e. Corvette) I recommend you park it in 15037306 street because 15037306 parking here is VERY steep!
