<p align="left">would again f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 check production there, and thus the paralysis would communicate itself through all the interlacings of industry and f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 commerce, 
producing everywhere a partial disjointing of production and exchange, and resulting in the phenomena that seem to show over-production or  ORCENJVYW </p>

<p>over-consumption, according to the standpoint f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 from which they are viewed. The period of depression thus ensuing would continue until (1) the 
speculative advance in rents BULONYNSI had been lost; or (2) the increase in the efficiency of labor, owing to the growth of population and the progress of 
improvement, had enabled f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 the normal rent line to overtake JWI the f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 speculative rent line; or (3) labor and f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 capital had become reconciled to engaging in 
production for smaller returns. Or, most f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 probably, all three of these causes would co-operate to produce a new equilibrium, at which all the 
forces of production would again engage, ALYTRID and a season of activity FSETNGABP ensue; whereupon rent would begin to advance again, a speculative advance again </p>

characteristic of modern civilization, where, moreover, there is no such thing as a distinct and independent industrial BDLMCTMN SHFDKK community, but geographically or politically separated communities blend and interlace 
their industrial f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 organizations in different modes and varying measures, it is not to be expected that effect should be seen to follow cause as clearly 
and WQGMWHNP definitely as would f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 FNEFKH be the case in a simpler development of industry, and in a community forming a complete and distinct industrial whole; but, 
nevertheless, the phenomena actually presented by these alternate seasons of activity and depression clearly correspond with UUK those we have inferred </p>
<BR><span style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif, Helvetica, Arial;"></span>
<p align="center">from the speculative advance of rent. Deduction thus shows the f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 actual phenomena as resulting from the principle. If we reverse the process, it is as easy by induction to reach the </p>
<BR><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Courier New, Times New Roman, Arial; font-size: 11px; color: #ffffff;"></span>
<p align="center" style="font: 9px;">principle by tracing up the phenomena. These seasons of depression are WXVL always preceded by seasons of activity and f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 speculation, and on all hands the connection between the two is 
admittedâ€”the depression being CRYP looked upon as the reaction from the f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 speculation, as the headache of the morning is the reaction from the 
debauch of the night. But as to the manner in<I>which the depression results from the f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047</I>speculation, there NIU are two clhies or schools of opinion, as the </p>
<BR><BR><span style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif, Times New Roman, Arial; font-size: 7px;"></span>
<p align="center">attempts made<I>on both sides of the Atlantic to account for the present industrial depression will show. One school says that the f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047</I>speculation produced the depression by causing 
over-production, and QUI points to the warehouses filled with goods that cannot be sold at remunerative prices, to mills closed or working on half time, to 
mines shut down and steamers laid up, to hi lying idly in bank vaults, and workmen compelled to idleness and privation. They point to these facts  PMOCL 
as showing that the production f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 has exceeded the demand XPB for consumption, and they point, moreover, to the fact that when government during war enters 
the EFGJ field as an enormous consumer, brisk times prevail, as in the United States during the civil war and in England during the Napoleonic struggle. .</p>
