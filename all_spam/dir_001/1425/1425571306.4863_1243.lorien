But the great cause of the triumph of this theory is, that, instead of menacing any vested right or antagonizing any powerful interest, f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 it is 
eminently soothing ENRQSLRM SPWAV and rehiuring to the clhies who, wielding the power of wealth, largely dominate thought. At a time when old supports were falling 
away, it came to the f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 rescue of the special privileges by which a few monopolize so f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 much of the good LRR things of this world, proclaiming a natural 
cause for the want and misery which, if attributed to political institutions, must condemn every government under which they exist. The  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
”Essay on Population“ was avowedly a reply to William Godwin’s ”Inquiry concerning political DNGNGSGAA justice,“ a work hierting the principle of human 
equality; and its purpose was to justify existing inequality by shifting the responsibility UHQDSKJGC for it from human CBPTNJKNL institutions to the IYFCE laws of the 
Creator. There was nothing new in this, for Wallace, nearly forty years before, had brought forward the danger of excessive multiplication as the  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
answer to the demands of justice for an equal distribution of wealth; but the circumstances of the times were such as to make UISC the same idea, when 
brought forward by malthus, peculiarly grateful to a powerful clhi, in whom an intense fear of any questioning of the existing state of things had  BBEDVNV </p>
<BR><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Courier New, Times New Roman, Arial; font-size: 7px; color: #ffffff;"></span>
<p align="left" style="font: 12px;">been generated by the outburst of the French Revolution. Now, as then, the Malthusian doctrine parries the demand for reform, and shelters selfishness from question and from conscience by the interposition  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
of an YGGKPK inevitable necessity. It furnishes NQBHHMTU a philosophy by which Dives as he feasts can shut out the image of Lazarus who faints with hunger at his 
door; by which wealth may complacently hion up its pocket when poverty asks an alms, and the rich Christian bend on Sundays in a nicely  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
upholstered pew to implore the good gifts of the All Father without any hiling of responsibility for the squalid misery that is festering but a  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
square away. For poverty, XEVFGA want, and starvation are by this theory not chargeable either to individual greed or to social maladjustments; they are 
the inevitable results of universal laws, with which, if it were not impious, it were as hopeless to quarrel as with the law of gravitation. In  BRU 
this view, he who in the<U>midst of want has accumulated wealth, FUVJ has but fenced in a little oasis from the</U>driving YSYWTFE f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 sand which else would have 
overwhelmed f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 it. f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 He has gained for himself, but has FUQ hurt nobody. And even if the rich were literally to obey the injunctions f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 of Christ and divide their 
wealth among the poor, nothing would be gained. Population would be increased, only to SORCVEY press again upon the limits of subsistence or capital, 
and the equality that would be produced would be but SEDOKM the equality of common misery. And thus reforms which would interfere QNE with the interests of any 
powerful clhi f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 are discouraged as hopeless. as the moral law forbids any forestalling of the methods by which the natural law gets rid of surplus 
population and thus holds in check f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 a tendency to f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 increase potent enough to pack the surface of the globe with human beings as sardines are packed in a .</p>
