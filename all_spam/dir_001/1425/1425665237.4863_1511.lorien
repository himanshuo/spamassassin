human factor as more than to compensate. Twenty men working together will, where nature is HMBOWUFLR niggardly, produce more than twenty times the wealth that 
one man can produce where nature is most bountiful. The denser the population the more minute becomes the subdivision of labor, f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 the greater 
the economies of production and distribution, and, hence, the very reverse of the Malthusian doctrine is true; and, within the limits in which we have  VKG 
reason to suppose increase would still go on, in any given state of civilization a greater number of people can produce a KOEULJSDP larger proportionate </p>

and<B>the production of wealth is largest—that constitutes the enigma which perplexes the civilized world, and which we are trying to</B>unravel.  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
Evidently the Malthusian theory, which attributes want to the decrease of productive power, will not explain it. That theory is utterly inconsistent  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
