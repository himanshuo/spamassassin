I was in the neighborhood and needed to grab a bite to eat. I walked in greeted and explained the menu. The workers here are very helpful and friendly. You have the option to make your own bowl or choose from a pre-set entr??e. I chose the Beef Up with coconut lime rice, coconut lemongrass steak, garlic kale, sweet tamarind slaw, S.E. Asian salsa, sambal corn and light pickles. For toppers, I chose crispy garlic (must) and crushed roasted peanuts. For my sauces, I chose a sweet soy glaze that I topped over the steak.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Kaya Street Kitchen is in direct competition with ShopHouse.  At this point, I don't think you can eat at either restaurant and escape the comparison to the other, these two restaurants are the asian fast food equivalent of the great Five Guys vs In N Out debate.  In my opinion, Kaya Street Kitchen, eeks on by with the win. 

Deciding between the coconut-lemongrass steak, the chicken satay, and the pork and shrimp lumpia-style meatballs might be difficult, but there's zero cause for despair. The fully customizable menu lets you choose all of them in the Super Bowl option  or in a trio of roti tacos or lettuce wraps. Stand outs for me protein wise are the steak and meatballs with coconut rice. And after you include the astounding range of slaws or, of course, garlic kale, you'll feel little guilt for blissing out on their namesake kaya toast -the voluptuous coconut jam is flavored by pandan leaves and finished with a perfect amount of salt.  Lest I forget, don't skip the garlic chips, if you're asian, they'll remind you of your childhood (at least if you're me anyways, if it doesn't remind you of yours then you were deprived as a child).

I seriously love this place, the portions are large, the prices low and the taste unbelievable.  Since it's opening, I think I order from them at least every other week.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
