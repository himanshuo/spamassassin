He played college football at Central Washington.Taimhotep t3mtp, in Greek , Taimuthis December 17, 73 BCE  February 15, 42 BCE was an ancient Egyptian woman known from two stelae made during the reign of Cleopatra VII. One of these, a limestone stela from 43 or 42 BCE was found in Memphis or Sakkara and is today in the British Museum BM 147, the other is a Demotic version of its text, its fragments are also in the British Museum BM 377.Stela BM 147 has a depiction of Taimhotep worshipping SokarOsiris, Apis, Isis, Nephtys, Horus, Anubis and a symbol of the West. The text on the stela is 21 lines long and tells Taimhotep's life. She was born in the 9th regnal year of Ptolemy XII Auletes, her father was apja Khahapi, a priest of Ptah, Min, KhnumRa and Horus, her mother was Herankh, a musician of the Ptah temple. She had a brother, High Priest Pasherienamun I and a sister called Taneferher, who married each other a further possible brother is the scribe Horemhotep. In the 23rd regnal year, at the age of fourteen July 25, 58 BCE she married the High Priest of Ptah, Pasherienptah III, and had three daughters and a son by him. Her children are named on the stela BM 377 the son ImhotepPedubast and the daughters Berenike, Herankh nicknamed Beludje and Kheredankh. It is known that Kheredankh was not her daughter, as she was born to Pasherienptah seven years before his marriage to Taimhotep, and her name was inscribed on the stela erroneously in place of her actual third daughter Her'an nicknamed Tapedibast, whose name can be found on another stela of her father Ash.
