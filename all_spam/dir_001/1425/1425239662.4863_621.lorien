Some truly tasty Mediterranean! You can't go wrong with the falafel or the chicken shwarma. Better for a lunch option than dinner, but I can eat here absolutely any time.

The namesake falafel is indeed delicious: crispy exterior, moist and fluffy inside, spot on flavor. Order it as a plate, a side, or wrapped in a pita or laffa.
Chicken shwarma is my favorite dish- here it's amazing! There's a hummus and shwarma dish that is awesome, but the laffa wrap is even better. 
On the laffa vs pita debate: here the laffa is clearly fresh made, pillowy, and warm. The pita I received was cold and seemed pre-made. Would steer clear of the pitas and pay the slight upcharge for the laffa. I do wish the wraps had more in them, like tomatoes, cucumber salad, tabouli, or hummus. Instead they are simple with tahini, meat, and lettuce.

Clean location, outdoor seating available, cards accepted, both bottled and fountain beverages. Order at a counter, service is quick.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
