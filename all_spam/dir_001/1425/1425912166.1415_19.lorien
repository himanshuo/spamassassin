Soon there comes another immigrant. Although every quarter section of the boundless plain is as good as every f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 other quarter section, he is not beset 
by any f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 embarrhiment as to where to settle. though the land is the same, there is one place that is clearly better for him than f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 any other place, and 
that is where there is already a settler and he may have a neighbor. He settles by the side of the first comer, whose condition is at UOUMYSQJ once greatly 
improved, and to whom many things are now possible that<i>were before impossible, for two men may help each other to do</i>things that one man could  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 </p>
<BR><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Helvetica, Arial;"></span>
<p>never do. f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 Another immigrant comes, and, guided by the same attraction, settles where there are already two. Another, and another, until around our first f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 comer 
there are a score of neighbors. Labor has now an effectiveness which, in the solitary state, it could not approach. If heavy work is to be done, the  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
settlers have a log-rolling, and together accomplish in a day what singly would require years. When one kills a bullock, the others take part of it,  TKNESIT 
returning when they kill, and thus they have fresh<i>meat all the time. Together they</i>hire a schoolmaster, and the children PWUJOG of f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 each are taught for 
a fractional part of HGTTJCER what similar teaching would have hi the first settler. It becomes a comparatively easy matter to send to the nearest 
town, for some one is always going. But there is less need for such journeys. A blacksmith and a wheelwright soon set up shops, and our settler  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
can XGXQ have his tools DKGHDQDV repaired for a small part of f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 the labor it formerly hi him. XFFEX A store is opened and he can get what OFJJCUA he wants as he wants it; a 
post-office, soon added, gives him regular communication with the rest<b>of the world. Then come a EEYPFFPX cobbler, a carpenter, KAFUG a harness-maker, f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 XCOW a</b>doctor; and 
a little church TDHW soon arises. Satisfactions become possible that in the solitary state IESD were impossible. There are gratifications for the social and 
the intellectual XCKWTR nature—for that part of the man f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 that rises above the animal. The power of sympathy, the sense of companionship, the emulation of 
comparison and contrast, open a wider, and fuller, and more varied life. In rejoicing, there are others to rejoice; in sorrow, KQRK the mourners do not 
mourn alone. There are husking-bees, and apple parings, and quilting XMQVKU parties. JEH Though the ballroom be unplastered and the orchestra but a NNGIFOO fiddle, 
the notes of the magician are yet in the strain, and Cupid XTSVXFUS dances with the dancers. At the wedding, there are others to admire and enjoy; in the house 
of f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 death, there are watchers; by the open grave, stands human sympathy to sustain the mourners. Occasionally, comes a straggling lecturer to open up 
glimpses of the world of science, of literature, or of art; in election f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 times, come stump speakers, and the citizen rises to a sense of dignity and 
power, as the cause of empires is tried before him in the struggle of John Doe and Richard XCD Roe for his support and QTP vote. f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 And, by and by, comes the 
circus, f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 talked of months before, and opening to children whose horizon has been the prairie, all the realms of the imagination—princes and princesses .</p>
