This is not a place that you go for the atmosphere. It is a place that you go for the food. The day that I was there 2 people were eating on the video game because there wasn't another table. I had the burnt ends and they were extremely absolutely perfect. I also tried the baked beans and wished that I had gone with another side instead. They were ok...but not my style. The mac and cheese was good, but again, not great. If I were just rating the meat this would be a 5 star restaurant. The sides drag it down a bit.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047.

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">We have been going here as a family since the early start of KTC and have been proud to watch it grow and shine. My husband and myself are proud supporters of this place and the owner Dave. He takes so much pride in the quality and integrity of food. 

Speaking of food... What amazing flavors and savory dishes. Some people may give the place a lower rating because Dave can sell out of items throughout the day and you might get a night when its slim pick'ns. But come on look at it this way there are just so many people racing to get this amazing food. He is just one man cook'n his heart out. We are multitides racing every day to have some of the great food. Just get there earlier and faster than everyone else and you're golden. 

Try the meat loaf its my favorite. More on the sweet side but still really savory. My husband enjoys the thick protein and less sweet brisket. Burnt ends and pulled pork are great choices for kids with a side of mac-n-cheese.

Dave has also put a twist on some traditional dishes I wouldn't normally eat. His version I just love. Rosta Corn, Chicken Gumbo just amazing sides with a chocolate pie.

Just remember if its your first time the race is on so get there early so you can have a full menu to taste.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
