		 8729663 sweetbreads,...too much breading and a bit gummy.  Scallops were delicious and lobster was overpowered by sauce. It was really fun to watch 8729663 flaming banana crepes being made but 8729663 taste paled in comparison to 8729663 food preparation. Staff was attentive at bringing food, yet never checked back to see if we were enjoying our meal. Biggest disappointement was 8729663 Sommelier.  We chose individual wine pairings and he did a nice job of explaining 8729663 wines but did not check back to see if we liked his choices.  I had a glass of really sour wine and had to flag him down to talk to him about getting a substitution.  To his credit, he quickly offered another wine yet failed to ask me why I did not like 8729663 rejected glass.  Not sure how he knew what I might like when he never asked me what was wrong with his first selection. Oh,...he did say to me, "You're probably jonesing for a glass of red wine."  Jonesing?  Really dude? Guess that 's my point...this is an expensive, destination restaurant and I was just expecting more. (sigh) 8729663 bar tender treated me as if I was 8729663 only person at 8729663 bar (there were at least another 8 people) and he did not have to make drinks for 8729663 people at tables. I went with his food recommendations, and they were amazing (some more than others). He really treated me with respect, etc. First I had 8729663 tuna appetizer. It was ok. Of all my dishes, this was not at 8729663 top. I would say it was really good, but not excellent. Next, I had 8729663 quail salad. Now, this was excellent. 8729663 flavors, presentation and portion were really perfect. My main course was seared scallops. Unbelievable. I can't remember 8729663 last time I really said scallops were unbelievable. Let me just say it one more time and then move on - - Unbelievable. I ended my meal with 8729663 Chocolate Souffle. It was very good. I wish I had tried 8729663 strawberry souffle (maybe next time). Of course, they brought 8729663 little dessert chocolates. Pretty good. If you are in San Francisco, this restaurant is an absolute MUST!! I took my boyfriend here for his birthday this week,
