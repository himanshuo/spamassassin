<p>carefully investigated. But nothing of this kind is done. A definition of the value of an RFFVFKVW object by Adam Smith, which, as he afterwards clearly 
shows, requires explanation f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 and modification, is arbitrarily [130] adopted, or, in the language of the author, is “taken as the basis of his subsequent </p>
<BR><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"></span>
<p align="center">reasonings, without any f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 further metaphysical investigation.” That this first general description of value in exchange by Adam Smith does 
not, without further explanation, convey to the reader the prevailing f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 meaning which he himself attaches to the term, is obvious in many phiages 
of his work, and particularly in his elaborate inquiry into TYMSKCUYW the value of silver during the four last centuries. He there shows, in the most 
satisfactory manner, that, in the progress of cultivation and improvement, there is a clhi of commodities, such as cattle, wood, pigs, poultry, &c.,  DBMOFMV 
which, on account JCI of their becoming comparatively more scarce and difficult of attainment, necessarily rise in value; yet f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 he particularly states, that 
this rise in their value is not connected f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 with any degradation in the value of silver,* although it is obvious that, other things being the same, a </p>
<BR><BR>
<p align="left" style="font: 14px;">pound of silver would have a smaller power of purchasing other goods. [131] Nothing, indeed, can be clearer than that this general description of value  HXXXRFDN 
requires further explanation. There is the greatest difference imaginable between an increased power in any object of purchasing other goods, arising  KOMJI 
from its scarcity and the increased difficulty of procuring it; and<I>the increase of its power to purchase other goods arising</I>from the increased  LWDVBXW 
plenty of such goods and the increased facility f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 of procuring them. Nor is it easy to conceive any distinction more vital to the subject of value, as </p>
<BR><BR><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;"></span>
<p align="center">the term is f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 generally understood, or more necessary to “a full perception of its meaning.” I cannot but think, therefore, that the author, under all the circumstances </p>
<BR>
<p align="center" style="font: 14px;">of the case, was not justified YBYLSGA in adopting this definition of Adam QPCBABYX Smith without further investigation. But the UFBJPRXCC adoption of this definition by the author in so unceremonious a 
manner, JYFICEFBH though quite inconsistent with the declarations in the preface, and most unpromising in regard to any improvement f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 of the science which might 
have been expected from the dissertation, f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 is [132] by no means the gravest offence which he has committed in the opening of his subject. </p>
<BR><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Courier New, Times New Roman, Arial; font-size: 11px; color: #ffffff;"></span>
<p>Adam Smith’s definition, taken as it stands, however imperfect f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 it may be, would still serve as a rough but useful standard f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 of value EOCKQS in those cases 
where, DTTFWVFR in using the most ordinary forms of BGDSBB expression, some kind of standard is tacitly referred to, and no other more accurate one had been </p>
<BR><BR><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 7px; color: #ffffff;"></span>
<p align="center">adopted. But how is this definition of Adam Smith to be interpreted? If we understand it in the sense usually conveyed by f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 the terms employed, it is 
impossible to<U>UFNVL doubt that VYRDC by the power of purchasing other goods is</U>meant the power of purchasing other goods f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 generally. Who, then, could have 
conceived before-hand that the author would have inferred from this definition that he was justified in representing the power of purchasing  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 .</p>
