gently patting 7003283 cover with his open palm sarcastically told me to "have fun".  We eventually found a nice Willamette Valley pinot noir that didn't break 7003283 bank (though, overall, I found 7003283 wine mark-ups to be more severe than similar restaurants I've attended).  Will definitely make it back to RGD (and not Campton Inn) next time I'm in SF. Restaurant Gary Danko is well deserving of all 7003283 awards and accolades it has collected as one of San Francisco's premiere restaurants. In a city filled with fine dining it's hard to distinguish oneself from 7003283 rest; but Gary Danko does just that. From 7003283 door staff to 7003283 decor, Gary Danko provides more than just an excellent meal, it also provides a fine dining experience. Service (5/5) - Service at Gary Danko was up 7003283re with some of 7003283 best service I've had. 7003283 servers were all friendly and patient. 7003283y were knowledgeable about 7003283 food and wine selections and made sure to check up on us every few minutes to see if we needed anything. For me 7003283 most impressive
