I must say, the service was great. Attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. Our food however, was not too impressive. For an appetizer, we had the Canoe smoked Salmon on a crispy potato cake. It was tasty, though a bit salty. As an entr??e we had the slow roasted Georgia rabbit and the the George's Bank Code. Although the rabbit was pretty tasty I was not impressed by it. The Code tasted buttery and watery (pretty disappointing) the only thing that cheered us up (other than the wine) was the PB and J chocolate cake - it was so delicious.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">I was not thrilled about going to Canoe. Looking at their menu, I thought it would be the same old stuff as I would get at South City Kitchen, Empire State South, or Common Quarter. 

Sure, 10 years ago, maybe Canoe would've been the bomb. But many farm-to-table, new-American restaurants popped up since then. So I thought I would be jaded by Canoe. 

Boy, I was wrong. Canoe is similar to those restaurants, but Canoe takes it a step higher. It is definitely a fancy-smacy, high-end restaurant. The service and food are high-class. I was pleasantly surprised. 

We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 entrees. What's cool about these appetizers, since we were sharing them, are that they made them into little courses. If you come with 2 people, you can probably order all the appetizers and have a 10-11 course meal. In fact, that is one option I recommend. 

Before the appetizers came, the bread lady came with several kinds of breads. We tried them all. All of the breads tasted good. I liked the cranberry bread the best.

For my appetizers, I tried their Hickory Smoked Duck Pastrami and their Oysters on the Half Shell. The Duck Pastrami was amazing. I loved everything that came with it. The Radish, Blood Orange, Beets, and Rye matched well with the duck. 

The Oysters were delicious as well. They tasted fresh and loved whatever stuff they put on it. 

For the entree, I tried the Slow Roasted Georgia Rabbit. It was a very good rabbit. The rabbit meat melted apart. The candied garlic sauce and the juice from the rabbit gave it a great flavor. It comes with Goat Cheese Tortellini, but I got it with bucatini because of the lactose in the Goat Cheese. I thought the bucatini was overcooked, however. Maybe changing the dish messed with the chefs. 

Canoe is sensitive to whatever food allergies you might have. So if you need to change a dish, they will do it with no problem. So I was happy they changed the tortellini.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
