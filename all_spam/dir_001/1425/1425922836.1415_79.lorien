You feel as though you just walked right into nonna's kitchen!  Like a fashionista embraced in a cashmere wrap, once you enter you are completely enveloped in homemade Italian goodness.  It's intoxicating & blissfully overwhelming.  

The staff speak fluent Italian.  My man (who is 100% Italian) also speaks fluent Italian.  I asked him to ask them what the difference between the piadina & the cassone was, then he explained it to me.  Of course the staff also speak English, but I let my man use this opportunity to show off his Italian tongue...

The piadina is a flatbread sandwich.  The cassone is a piadina that has been grilled.  

We ordered everything to go.  
The sausage cassone, the special gnocchi entree, & meatballs w flatbread.  

The cassone is a cleaner & modified version of a calzone.  And much better imo.  Delish.

The special gnocchi.  Asparagus & speck in a delicious white sauce.  The gnocchi were divine, pillowy perfection.  Dreamy.  Success.  

The meatballs were rich & full of flavor; but the star was the red sauce.  Thick & zesty, we sopped it all up w the flatbread...perfect marriage.

Seriously, their red sauce & that white gnocchi sauce could turn stale bread into straight up lusciousness on a plate.  

We enjoyed our dinner with a couple of glasses of red wine.  It was the perfect meal.

Uber homey & casual, w an array of outstanding Italian dishes.  Fresh pastas to take home & cook.  Various hot prepared items.  And those fab piadinas & cassones!  Lasagna & the gnocchi roll are next on my list.  

It's impressively apparent that TIHC is a product of love & passion that manifests in everything they prepare.  

TIHC could not be more authentic, warm, or positive.  North Beach has gained an extraordinary addition to the neighborhood.  Mangia mangia!f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
