Dear Sir,

I am Mr Bona Chan staff of a financial firm in South East Asia and i am contacting for a good proposal that will benefit both of us if you are interested, please reply back.

You are my first contact,and I am contacting you because I need to do the deal with someone outside my country who is not known by my co staffs or friends,not that is a risky business please be rest that is risk free but it's not the type of deal you let someone around you to be aware of even my bank do not even know that I am contacting you as it will be a deal between me and you.

I will explain better when I get your response,I shall wait for days and if I do not hear from you, I shall look for another person.

Thanks,
Mr Bona Chan
