Edward160III transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe. His long reign of fifty years also saw vital developments in legislation and governmentin particular the evolution of the English parliamentas well as the ravages of the Black Death.Edward was crowned at age fourteen after his father was deposed by his mother and her lover Roger Mortimer. At age seventeen he led a successful coup against Mortimer, the de facto ruler of the country, and began his personal reign. After a successful campaign in Scotland he declared himself rightful heir to the French throne in 1337 but his claim was denied due to the Salic law. This started what would become known as the Hundred Years' War. Following some initial setbacks the war went exceptionally well for England victories at Crcy and Poitiers led to the highly favourable Treaty of Brtigny. Edward's later years, however, were marked by international failure and domestic strife, largely as a result of his inactivity and poor health.Edward was crowned at age fourteen after his father was deposed by his mother and her lover Roger Mortimer.
