Environment: Prior to my visit, I read quite a few reviews about the area.  I do agree with them.  However, I will say, like of other bad areas in LA, as long as you don't go walking around and acting you like you are above these folks, you'll be fine.  You will already stick out like a sore thumb, but just don't act like a rich, snobby, douchebag.  I stood on the corner with my friend for about 30 minutes and many locals walked by us giving a quick "what's up" or "how you doing".  I think a plus to the environment is that there is no one bothering you for some change or something to eat.  People are selling things but they ask you once and will move on.  I say that because I have a few friends who won't dare eat in that type of setting.

Seating: You may find some recent reviews where people mention the small eating area.  It is small, but they do add this little tent where additional folks can sit.  Not sure if you have seen any reviews, but I would suggest eating next to your if you happen to not find a seat.  Again, don't worry about your surroundings.  No one will bother you.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
