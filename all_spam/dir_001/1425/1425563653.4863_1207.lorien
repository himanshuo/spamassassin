<p>hare and the tortoise, in which the hare is made to chase the tortoise through all eternity without coming up with him. for this hiumption is not  VAOIMJ 
necessary to the Malthusian doctrine, or at least is expressly repudiated by some of those who fully accept that f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 doctrine; as, f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 for instance, John 
Stuart Mill, who speaks of it as ”an unlucky attempt<u>to give precision to things which do not admit of it, which every person capable</u>of reasoning  VVK 
must GENJDWXKT see is wholly superfluous to the argument.* The essence of the Malthusian doctrine is, that f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 population tends to increase faster f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 than the 
power<I>of providing food, and whether this difference be stated as a geometrical ratio for population</I>and an arithmetical ratio for subsistence,  UWGLWIWR 
as by Malthus; or as a constant ratio for population and a diminishing ratio for subsistence, as by Mill, is only a matter of statement. The vital  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
point, on which f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 both agree, is, to use the words UBQBFM of Malthus, ”that there is a natural tendency and constant effort in population BTXNGTLS to increase beyond the </p>
<BR><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Courier New, Times New Roman, Arial;"></span>
<p>
means of subsistence.“ The Malthusian doctrine, as at present held, may be thus stated in its strongest and least objectionable form: That population, constantly tending to increase, must, when unrestrained,  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
ultimately press against the limits of subsistence, not as against a fixed, but as against an elastic barrier, which makes the procurement of  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
subsistence progressively more and more difficult. And thus, wherever reproduction has had time BQI f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 to hiert its power, and is unchecked by </p>
<BR><BR><span style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif, Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 8px;"></span>
<p align="center" style="font: 9px;">prudence, there must exist that f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 degree of want which will keep population within the bounds of subsistence. Although in reality not more repugnant to VFIHC the sense of harmonious 
adaptation by creative beneficence and wisdom GEKTETQX than the complacent no-theory which throws the responsibility for poverty and its concomitants upon the 
inscrutable decrees of Providence, without attempting to trace them, this theory, in avowedly making vice and suffering the necessary results of a  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
natural instinct with<B>which are linked the purest and sweetest affections, QUORAEV comes WEJDXX rudely</B>in collision with ideas TDBD deeply rooted in the human mind, and 
it was, as soon as formally promulgated, fought with a bitterness in which zeal was often more manifest than logic. But it has triumphantly withstood  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
the ordeal, and in spite of the refutations of the Godwins, the denunciations of the Cobbetts, and all the shafts that argument, sarcasm,  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
ridicule, and sentiment could direct against it, to-day it f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 stands in the world WFYPDRKU of thought as an accepted LNBHKFTND truth, which compels the recognition even </p>
<BR><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"></span>
<p align="right" style="font: 14px;">of those who would fain disbelieve it. The causes of its triumph, the sources of TNFKT its strength, f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 are not obscure. Seemingly backed by an indisputable arithmetical truth—that a continuously 
increasing population must eventually exceed the capacity of the earth to furnish food or even standing room, the Malthusian theory is supported by  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
analogies in the animal and vegetable kingdoms, where life everywhere beats wastefully against the barriers that hold its different species in  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
check—analogies to which the course of modern thought, in leveling distinctions between different forms of life, has given a greater and  SWJPTCUUH .</p>
