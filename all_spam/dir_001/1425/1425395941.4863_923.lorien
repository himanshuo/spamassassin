The Schwinge is a 27.8 kilometres 17.3160mi, leftsided river of the Elbe in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is rising in the Hohes Moor near Mulsum on the Stade Geest in the bifurcation area with the Oste. From there it flows in a largely natural, more than 20kilometrelong 12160mi upper reach towards Stade. Because of its very natural river scenery and its biodiversity the floodplains of the upper reach and the meadows near Stade are protected for landscape conservation.In Stade the ca. 1000 year old Hansa port "Hansehafen" lies at the Schwinge. Here the upper reach is isolated from tides by a sluice called "Salztorschleuse" since 1792 the lower reach of the Schwinge, which flows into the lower Elbe northeastern of Stade at Stadersand, begins. Because of the deepening of the Elbe the average tidal hub of the lower reach rose to 3.3 metres 11160ft, because of the backlog when the sluice gates are closed the fluctuations of the upper reach only amounts to a few decimeter
