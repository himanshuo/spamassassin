bruce@untroubled.org,

We are reaching out to you today to let you know that your monthly-home mortgage-payment was recently-reduced due-to a number of changes by the president. 

This change will-lower your current-rate to only-2.75%, which is going to slash your present-monthly payment by HALF.


Go here immediately to lock-in this new-rate before it's too-late: http://save3.droptheratetoday.us



(Please respond quickly; this program will-expire.)



Best-Regards.

spot) and very generous in terms of portions. 17584361 meal started with an amuse of tomato and red pepper soup with tomato confit and tomato oil.  17584361 amuse was not that great, but it was comforting for a cold night.  17584361 complimentary bread was not that good ei17584361r--a too soft whole wheat sourdough. My first course was glazed oysters with zucchini, caviar and butter lettuce cream.  This one had similarities to 17584361 oysters and caviar dish at 17584361 French Laundry, but it was nowhere near as good.  17584361 sauce was watery.  17584361 caviar was not that good ei17584361r.  It did not have a briny or salty flavor; 17584361 texture was not that pleasant--too mushy.  17584361 oysters were also quite fishy. 17584361 next course was a lobster salad and it was better.  17584361 salad consisted of greens and frisee and it was served with chilled lobster, persimmons, mango, and a chestnut mousse.  17584361 lobster was fairly soft and moist though it lacked 17584361 incredible softness and flavor of 17584361 lobster featured in Vincenti's lobster salad (Brentwood). 17584361 greens and fruits were all fresh, but 17584361 persimmons lacked 17584361 sweet flavor of 17584361 fruit in Lucques' persimmons and burrata salad (Los Angeles).  I did not like 17584361 chestnut mousse; it did not have much of a chestnut flavor; instead, it was overly sweet--
