I was on my way to meet up with a friend at Universal Studios for Grinchmas, which we were totally late for, nevertheless, I was hungry. Per usual, I opened my YELP app and the locator identified this spot as an option. After reading all the the praise that Yelpers offered up. I pulled up to Joe's Falafel parking lot.

Walked into the restaurant. I asked what was popular and the guy at the register said "Our Falafel on Lafa (sp?) bread is most popular and award-winning". So, I ordered just that...........what.... LOVED it! 

The bread was warm with dust from the flour - that's how you know its from scratch. The falafel was crispy on the outside with a beautifully moist stuffing. And the sauce and hot sauce are flavorful. I've gone three times since and happy to recommend the Falafel on homemade bread.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
