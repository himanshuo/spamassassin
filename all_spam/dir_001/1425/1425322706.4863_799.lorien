<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Black Hoof bears a great resemblance to "animal restaurant" from LA. Creative tapas-style meat-centric dishes that would take your tastebuds to an exciting roller-coaster ride. This restaurant is by far my favorite restaurant in Toronto. To experience their full menu, I highly suggest going there with a group with no less than 4 people, you won't regret it.

Horse tartare (5/5) - This was superior to any beef tartare I've had so far. The meat was extremely delicate, sort of reminded me of tuna. 

Bone marrow (4/5) - Again, this was probably the best bone marrow I've had. I was actually not a fan of bone marrow, because I felt they were too fatty and lack an inherent flavor. Somehow the bone marrow from the Black Hoof made me view it in a new light.

Beef Heart & XO (5/5) - Their beef heart was cooked rare (when I say rare, I mean half-raw rare). Some people may have problems with it but I've had raw beef heart sashimi in Japan and it was mindblowingly good. I'm convinced that this is the best way of eating beef heart.

Liver (4/5) - A solid dish, but it did not blow my mind

Tripe Karaage (4.5/5) - Growing up in an asian family, we ate tripe quite often. However, I was surprised at the fact that the texture of this tripe was nothing like the tripes I've had previously. It wasn't as "crunchy" yet the flavor was still there.

Fried sweetbreads (3.5/5) - Not the best sweetbreads I've had, but still fairly decent.
Tongue on brioche (5/5) - This dish was constructed similar to a roast beef sandwich, but what surprised me the most was that the texture of the tongue. Normally, tongues should be quite firm and even a little crunchy. Their tongue was thinly sliced, extremely soft and tender, paired with the richness of the brioche, this was the ultimate roast beef sandwich.

Foie and pancake (5/5) - Foie gras goes well with sweet sauce, but these guys took it to another level by making it a desert! It had a nice balance between sweet and savory, and their foie gras was also cooked to perfection. Don't bother with the other foie gras dish they have here (the other one is terrine I believe), get this.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
