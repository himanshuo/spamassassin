It was introduced in 1957 and distributed by Steineck's company Concava S.A and remained in production up to 1996. The Tessina takes 14x21160mm pictures on standard 35160mm film loaded into a special cassette, making it one of the few subminiature cameras to use the format. It is a very small 2.5x2x1160inch twin lens reflex, with two 25160mm f2.8 Tessinon lenses,one for taking picture, one for viewing on a tiny groundglass focusing screen on top of the camera. A 45 mirror is employed to bend incoming light onto the film, which lies along the bottom of the camera rather than the back to save space. Apertures are continuously variable down to f22, and shutter speeds range from 12 to 1500, and B. The Tessina 35, Tessina L can focus down to 9 inches, Tessina Automatic 35mm to 12 inches. The film is advanced via a clockwork master spring built into the takeup spool, with a pullout winder like the crown on a wristwatch. Each winding can last up to 8 exposures.Three models have been produced Tessina Automatic 35mm, Tessina 35 and Tessina L available were a variety of colorfinish combinations that included brushed, painted or anodized aluminium, black and aluminium, all black, gold and red.
