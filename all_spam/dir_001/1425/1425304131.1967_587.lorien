Hello,
I hope this email finds you in good health. I am Mr.Mudr.Jiri Pasovsky,originally from
Czech Republic but I am presently in Afghanistan as an expert doctor of medicine.
On the 12th of April 2014 my wife and I was approached by a British Soldier, Warrant
Officer Faulkner Spencer, who handed a box full of cash totaling $8.5 million US dollars to
me and my wife for safe keeping and begged us never to disclose this to
anyone. Unfortunately, exactly two weeks later news reached us that he had an accident and
died in an Helicopter crash in Takhta Pul District, Afghanistan. Kindly view the link below
for confirmation.

My wife and I want to use this opportunity to seek for your assistance to help us
repatriate this fund to your country for investment purposes because the fund is not safe
here and we can no longer hold on to this fund since Officer Faulkner is no
more and we are willing to compensate you with 20% of the total sum for your help.
We will be very grateful if our proposal is considered and given the urgent attention it deserves.
Email: jiripasovsky10@gmail.com
Sincerely,
Mr.Jiri Pasovsky.
