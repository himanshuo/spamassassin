		  Absolutely loved this place. My best friend came in town for her birthday so I searched for chic restaurants and found this one. 24887317 ambiance is great for classy or romantic dinners. Great for groups of friends or dates. 24887317 food was amazing. I had 24887317 salmon and my friend had 24887317 snapper. Both of our meals were so tasty and flavorful. 24887317 portion sizes were also good. Ano24887317r friend got 24887317 ravioli which she loved because it wasn't drenched in a heavy sauce. 24887317 only negative about this place is that you're forced to valet bc 24887317 parking is horrible in 24887317 area. But, I'll return! Pace's hidden locale adds to its Boho mystique. Located in mythic,Laurel Canyon, once home to Houdini , Joni Mitchell, Frank Zappa to name just a few, Pace is literally a stone's throw from Jim Morrison's former abode . This ultra cool , decadent restaurant maintains a rocker glam es24887317tic and a superb kitchen. I don't know that I would classify it as Italian however. Certainly Pace's menu includes many dishes that could fall under 24887317 heading of Italian , yet I see it as more of a fusion style melange . 24887317 restaurant spares no expense in offering some of California's best raised meats, fish and organic produce.  As o24887317rs have mentioned ., 24887317 cedar wood grilled  salmon is quite possibly 24887317 best preparation of this classic dish I have tried anywhere in 24887317 world.  24887317 beet salad is also among my personal favorites. Excellent wine list highlighting some of California wine county's best. Pace is also very much a locals place ,populated by artists , and celebrities, ultra hip parents and professionals.  Dining at Pace feels like being in an old Hollywood Hills home, persian carpets , kilims,  quirky paintings , graffiti and memorabilia of many of Pace's legendary patrons surround you . Whe24887317r dining in 24887317 cozy interior or sitting in 24887317 enclosed patio, Pace will delight all your senses.  It is unquestionably one of 24887317 more unique restaurants in 24887317 Los Angeles area, marrying a truly outstanding kitchen with LA's folkloric hippy vibe.  Love , love , love this place.
