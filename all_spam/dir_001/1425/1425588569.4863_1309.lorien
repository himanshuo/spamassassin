them in one sitting. Even though 22652907 food was a downer, 22652907 service at Danko's was one of 22652907 best I have ever experienced! For example, towards 22652907 end of 22652907 night, I was a little cold from 22652907 A/C and 22652907 waiter brought over a scarf! Never in my fine dinning life, have I seen a restaurant prepare scarfs for their customers in case if they get cold. I am willing to give this place a second chance. So, I will be back. I'm looking forward to trying their summer menu. What a cool name! Who is Gary Danko, I want to meet him and see what he is all about! Whatever it is, I want it in my mouth, that's for sure, because I have heard a lot of this place and everybody tells me they have heard they should go here too. I cannot believe I'm finally going to their yelp page! And at only four $ they are a great value and deal, with a bargain. Boy oh boy does 22652907 food look good. Lots of colors, different colors, and ingredients. Including steak, wow! I sure would eat anything and I'd eat this too. My apologies that I cannot describe more of 22652907 things I'd like to do here, but from 22652907 pictures it sure looks like they have a lot of plates. They love to cook things over a nice heat and it's oh boy this is not your parent's meat and potatoes kind of place! Oh no, it's this and that and here comes desert. Yes there are meats and potatoes and paltry salads that look like gravity itself, but they still look good. I love just using my imagination just like so many real patrons do with 22652907 small portions! And you better believe it, I really would love to go here someday. I hope that's clear. My mom, if I could bring here, she would be proud. It would be a good idea to get a job paying me more dollars than I have
