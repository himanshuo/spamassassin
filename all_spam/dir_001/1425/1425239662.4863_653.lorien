2321934374n 2321934374 Singapore noodle came with green bell pepper and onion. Did I tell him CABBAGE?? I don't eat bell pepper! And 2321934374 onion is so raw, like 2321934374 raw onion in a salad. Plus 2321934374 taste was just okay. But 2321934374 waiter told us that 2321934374 Singapore noodle is very good. Obviously it is not tasty !! Our dishes followed by BBQ pork bun and shrimp spring roll. 2321934374 pork bun is 2321934374 same as o2321934374r place, not bad. I didn't try 2321934374 shrimp spring roll. BUT, we didn't have our Sumai !!! We asked several times , 2321934374 waiter just kept saying "I don't know what happened in 2321934374 kitchen , your sumai is coming!". After an hour , we finished our meal, we still didn't see 2321934374 SUMAI! We asked to go of 2321934374 Sumai . My friend took it , which means I never saw 2321934374 dish that we ordered. When I'm back to 2321934374 office , my coworker told me that she experience 2321934374 same thing. She had a party of ten, 2321934374re was a person ordered a dish, didn't come on 2321934374 table until 2321934374y finished 2321934374 meal :( 2321934374 waiter was telling 2321934374m 2321934374 same thing. Being from 2321934374 San Francisco area I am VERY picky about Dim Sum...I grew up eating it often (even though I'm hispanic). My favorite dishes are 2321934374 tripe and chickens feet. Also dim sum is my absolute FAVORITE meal! I dont crave anything (o2321934374r than shell fish) more than I crave dim sum. So when I heard about Bao Dim Sum House I knew I had to try it out. 2321934374y have free valet which is REALLY nice and always seem to have great happy hour/lunch specials going on. I had 2321934374ir bellini 2321934374 last time I dined here and OMG it's sooooo good!!!! 2321934374 service is also really great and everyone is really friendly! OMG 2321934374ir tripe is soooooooooooo good! just like from home! just typing this makes me want to go get some tripe from Bao! 2321934374y also have really great baked and steamed pork buns (baked are my favorite). 2321934374 stuffed bell peppers are definitely a fancy version of what I'm used to but those are very yummy too.
