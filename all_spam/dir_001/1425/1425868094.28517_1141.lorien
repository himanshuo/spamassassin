Good Day My Dear,

     Please acknowledge and accept my proposal.

 My name is Mrs. Grace Cantoss Salarich; I am the foreign exchange reserves manager at a vault of a financial & security Institute here in Spain. I am writing to notify you of the unclaimed inheritance deposit sum of $28,745,000.00 (Twenty Eight Million, Seven Hundred and Forty Five Thousand US Dollars) of our late Client, a citizen of your country that shares the same surname with you who passed on to Great beyond on July 23rd, 2009 in a fatal motor accident in auto pista de Porto Portugal.

The banking policy can only allow the release of such funds to a benefactor through an application as next of kin to the deceased. After his death, the bank has been expecting a possible beneficiary, but no luck, this institute has exploited all its ethical possibilities in other to contact his possible relation or inheritor, but no success. Since no one has come up since four Years.

I have made my own research with the help of private investigator, it is my knowledge that this man has been living in Spain for the past 17years and has never returned back home and I also learn't that his wife and 9years old daughter died with him during this accident. I am almost 110% sure that no one is aware of the existence of these funds.

However, because of the international financial crises, a lot of reform has been made within the Spanish financial system; this includes the new law on succession/claims which indicates a duration in which such inheritance could be tolerated. Hence, I contact you to stand as the relative to make the claim for you having the same last Name.

Upon your honest and sincere acceptance to cooperate with me, I agree that 40% of this money will be for you, 60% for me. I hereby advice that you reply to me first with your ( 1).Your full Names & Address. (2).Your Telephone and Fax numbers through my private email address: gracecantoss@aol.com if you are honestly willing to co-operate with me so that I would be able to give you a call to explain to you in details on how this could be concluded. Thanks for your understanding.

Have a blissful day.

Regards,
Mrs. Grace C. Salarich
