Dear friend,

I hope this proposal meets you in a good state of health.

Please can you help me re-profile fund? I am Mr Nobuyuki Hirano, President and CEO of The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. You can read about my Biography here: http://www.4-traders.com/business-leaders/Nobuyuki-Hirano-0676SZ-E/biography/
 
A sum of $23,200,000.00 USD (Twenty three million, two Hundred Thousand dollars)  was deposited by my Late customer (Fadel Ahmed) who died without declaring any next of kin before his death in 2009.

My suggestion to you is to stand as the next of kin to Fadel Ahmed. We shall share in the ratio of 50% for me, 50% for you. Contact me via this e- mail: mr.nobuyukihirano@foxmail.com

Please let me know your interest on this subject matter

Sincerely,
Mr.Nobuyuki Hirano
