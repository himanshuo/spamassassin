If it were possible, I'd give this place 6 stars. It's absolutely my favorite place to eat in Chicago.

Simply put, they just know how to do it right. Their food is freshly cooked to your specific preference, and I have yet to try one dish that I won't crave for the next week after. They have such a large menu, with options for every type of eater. Not to mention, for the amazing quality and flavor of their food, they could easily charge way more than they do. The prices are seriously fantastic, which shows a lot about their ownership. You can tell they're in this industry not only because they really believe in their product, but because they value honorable service and want to make their customers happy. 

Omar, or "Huge" as you might know him, might genuinely be the nicest person I've ever met. You can tell he really cares about every person that walks through the door, and he will go out of his way to make sure that you have a great experience. He's clearly a hard worker, and very dedicated to making this business successful.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
