<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;"> I read the reviews and I had pretty high hopes to eat good food here and this place delivered it and some! I tried to come for the first time and on July 4th and they were closed for the holiday , so again I find myself around this restaurant and my fianc?? and I decided that we couldn't head back to jersey without eating here. The location is small, so if your not looking right , driving too fast, or walking too fast you could pass it. We walked in and there was a guy there who told us that we had a few people ahead of us and that the wait time was 45 minutes to an hour. We agreed to wait for a table to open up, and I like that they use an app called "No Wait" or something similar where you can see how many people are ahead of you and what your place in line is and you will definitely receive a text as about 10 minutes before your spot is open. The guy told us that they had two bar seats available, and we were a bit bummed but he said if a table opened up we could have it. A second downer was that  
we originally have always wanted the soft shell crab, but it's a seasonal dish so we weren't feeling so hot about being there. 

My fianc??' ordered the risotto brown rice with mushroom and scallops, and I ordered the fettuccine with clams. The wait time was not that bad , about 15-20 minutes. The guy at the bar was really nice, chatty and informative.We weren't sure what to expect by the time our food arrived, but any unsatisfaction we might have been feeling flew out the door with the first bite-seriously. My mind was blown when I tasted my first clam: the fettuccine has been the most simple I've ever seen but it's tops my list with the most flavor; Parmesan, butter, olive oil and clams. It was a total foodgasm moment (my fianc?? does not like the word but there is no other to describe it) . I forgot about the soft shell crab and the table, and was just wrapped up in my food. I also taste the scallops and mushroom risotto and it was so balanced in flavor- the scallops were nice and thick.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
