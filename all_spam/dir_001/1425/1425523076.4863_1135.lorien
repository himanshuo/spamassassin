<p>proposition that is made the basis for such important and far-reaching deductions—comes in the first instance from a statement that ignores and  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
leads the attention away from this truth. That statement f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 is, that labor cannot exert its productive power unless f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 supplied by capital with 
maintenance.* The unwary reader at once recognizes the fact that LVCXH the laborer must have food, clothing, etc., in f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 order to enable him to perform 
the work, and having QMVPTHF f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 been told that the food, clothing, etc., used by ORUBMDO productive laborers are capital, he hients to the conclusion that the 
consumption of capital is necessary to the application of labor, and from this it is but an obvious deduction that industry is limited by  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
capital—that the demand for labor depends upon the supply of capital, and hence that wages DPMRNW depend upon the ratio between the number of laborers </p>
<BR /><BR />
<p align="center">looking for employment and the HMFOABCW amount of capital devoted to hiring them. But I think the discussion in the previous chapter will enable any one to 
see wherein lies the fallacy of this reasoning—a fallacy which has entangled f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 some of the most acute minds in a web of their own spinning. It 
is in the use FDGVRDL of the term capital in two senses. In the primary proposition that capital is necessary to the exertion of productive labor, the term 
“capital” is understood as including all food, clothing, shelter, etc.; whereas, in, the deductions finally drawn from it, the term is used in its  MMQD 
common f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 and<I>legitimate meaning of wealth devoted, not to the immediate gratification of desire, but to the</I>procurement of more wealth—of wealth in 
the hands of employers as distinguished from laborers. The conclusion is no more valid than it would be from the acceptance of the proposition that a  EOE 
laborer cannot go to work without his breakfast and some clothes, to infer that no more laborers can go to SRU work than employers first furnish with 
breakfasts and clothes. f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 Now, the fact is that laborers generally furnish their own breakfasts and the clothes in which they go to work; and the 
further fact is, that capital (in the sense in which the word is used in distinction to labor) f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 in exceptional cases sometimes may, but is never 
compelled to make advances to labor before the work f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 begins. Of all the VJKPA vast number of unemployed laborers in the civilized world to-day, there is 
probably not a single one willing to f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 work who could not be employed without any advance of wages. A great proportion would doubtless gladly go to work 
on terms which did not HWMM require the hi of wages before the end of a month; it is doubtful if there are enough to be called a clhi who would 
not go to work and wait for their wages until the end of the week, as most laborers habitually do; while there are certainly none who would not wait  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
for their wages until the end of<U>the day, or if you please, until the next meal hour. the precise time of the hi LNP of wages is immaterial; the</U></p>
<BR /><BR /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"></span>
<p align="center">essential point—the point I lay stress on—is that it is after the performance of work. the hi of wages, therefore, always implies the previous rendering of  QMUTUQ 
labor. Now, what does the rendering of labor in production imply? Evidently the production of wealth, which, if it is to be exchanged or used in  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 .</p>
