This was probably one of the most memorable meals my husband and I have had in recent months, both because the food was incredible and because the staff was so warm and friendly. I'll come clean and say that we were definitely THOSE Americans who ordered so much food that the manager had to come out and say it's ok if we change our minds and can't eat the last plate. (Don't worry, we ate from all our plates but did take some home....and couldn't really breathe). Between the salmon sampler, Brussels sprouts, mushroom gratin, risotto, striploin and caprese salad, we definitely embarrassed ourselves but loved everything we had. A great way to experience Vancouver and definitely worth a visit.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

On a Sunday at about 5 pm, I was seated instantly at the bar. Thank goodness happy hour is offered every day!

I opted for the truffle mac and cheese, the salmon cakes, and the Brussel sprouts. The former two are on the HH menu but the last is only on the dinner menu. 

I also got a glass of the house blend red wine. On the HH menu it's only four dollars. Of course it won't be amazing but it definitely does the trick and helps you unwind if that's what you're looking for. 

The truffle mac and cheese portion was generous. You could certainly taste and smell the truffle, too. I was a little worried that because it was on HH menu at five dollars that they'd cheap out on the truffle but this was not the case. 

The salmon cakes were decent although not the highlight of the evening. You get three. It comes with a side of tartar sauce. I personally like my sauce with a bit more of a tart flavor. The salmon is mashed up and then deep fried so it's a little oily. I'd definitely order them again though because they were only five dollars. 

The sprouts were excellent. At first I thought they were overly seasoned but once I mixed them around it was perfect. There were capers. There was Parmesan. They was a dash of lemon. And there were these little fried crispy strips too. It was an amazing combination and one that I'd likely not be able to reproduce in my own kitchen. Price tag: six dollars. 

Service: sat at the bar but still had a waitress. She was warm and friendly and she smiled a lot. She checked up on me often, especially when it came time for last call. 

Bottom line: great choice for dinner or HH in hip Yaletown!f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
