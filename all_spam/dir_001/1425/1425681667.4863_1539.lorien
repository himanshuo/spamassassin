<p align="left">the products of human exertion are excluded, and of the lumped his for the use of houses, farms, etc., only that part is rent which constitutes  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
the consideration for the use of the landâ€”that part paid for the use of buildings or other improvements being properly interest, as it is a  LIOIMYP </p>
<BR>
<p align="right">consideration for the use of capital. It is wider in this: In common speech we speak of rent only when owner and user are distinct persons. But in the economic sense there is also rent  LMN 
where f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 the UJM same person is both owner and user. Where owner and user are thus the same person, whatever part of his income he might obtain by letting f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 the 
land to another is rent, while the return for his labor and capital are that part of his income which they would yield him ECQBPG did he hire instead of 
owning<b>the land. Rent is also expressed in a selling price. When land is</b>purchased, the f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 hi which is made for the ownership, or right to 
perpetual use, is rent commuted or capitalized. If I buy land for a small price and hold it until I can sell it for a large price, f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 I have become 
rich, not by wages for my labor or by interest upon my capital, but by the increase of rent. Rent, in short, is the share in the wealth produced which  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
the exclusive right to the use of natural capabilities gives to the owner. GTESESM Wherever land has an exchange value there is rent in the economic meaning 
of the term. Wherever land having YNYUTM a value is used, either by owner or hirer there is rent f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 actual; wherever it is not used, but still has a value, there 
is f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 rent potential. It is this capacity of yielding rent which DIXRJ gives value to land. Until its ownership will confer some advantage, land has no </p>
<BR>
<p align="right" style="font: 12px;">value.* Thus rent or land value does not arise from the productiveness or f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 utility of land. It in no wise represents any help or advantage given to 
production, but simply the power f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 of securing a part of the results of production. No matter what are its capabilities, land can yield no rent and 
have no value until f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 some one is willing to give labor or the results of labor for the privilege of using it; and what NDVBB any one will thus give 
depends not upon the capacity of f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 the land, but upon its capacity as compared with that HQHJHK of land that can be had for nothing. I may have very 
rich land, but it will yield no rent and have no value so long as there is other land as good to be had without hi. but when this other land is  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
appropriated, and the best land to be had for nothing is inferior, either in fertility, situation, or BPRUV other quality, my land will begin to have a 
value and yield rent.<B>And though the productiveness of my land may decrease, yet if the productiveness of the land</B>to be had without charge  KYPXBDY 
decreases in greater proportion, the rent I can get, and consequently the value of my land, will steadily f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 increase. Rent, in short, is the price of 
monopoly, arising from the reduction to individual ownership of natural elements which f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 human exertion can neither produce nor increase. </p>
