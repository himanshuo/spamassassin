Husband had the chirashi & some nigri - which was decently portioned for the price and the fish itself was great. I ordered the black cod since I'd seen it pop up in so many reviews (and I needed something non-raw to eat) along with a couple of eel hand rolls. The eel was great, ranks high up on "best eel" I've had list. However the problem was the black cod. Taste itself, it was good and well made. If only they would have told us it would take almost 30 mins for it to be cooked. It probably only took us 15 mins to eat the rest of the food and then we were left sitting there, twiddling our thumbs waiting for the black cod...f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">We got here at 11:36am, 6 minutes before opening. All the tables were full, except for the one at the sushi bar. We waited a full hour for the corner table to open up - there were other seats available after 40 minutes, but we were spending a lot of money here so we decided to wait for our favourite spot. 

I started the meal out with an unusal order: the Uni Tororo (sea urchin and mountain potato paste). It was presented nicely, but the dish definitely did not hit the right spots on my tongue (lol). The sea urchin lacked flavour and was very slimy - it had a very subtle cucumber taste in my opinion. The mountain potato taste was very bland - it had an easier, more firm, texture to swallow.

For sashimi, we ordered the special assorted sashimi (tuna, salmon, hokki, octopus, white fish). All were served fresh and were most amazing with bright colours! In order, my favourites were: tuna, salmon, hokki, octopus, white fish. If I were to some back, I would just order the tuna. The tuna had a wonderful, almost creamy, texture that just melted in my mouth.

I absolutely loved the beef inari. The beef, rice, and deep fried bean curd all tasted faboulous together. The Shibazuke (pickle) inari, however, was less wonderful. There was not a lot of pickle, and I couldn't taste it over the rice. I would order the beef again, and try the eel next time.

The tamago sushi was full-sized, which I was very happy to see. Perfect egg to rice ratio. I enjoyed it; however, it was the sweetest tamago I have ever eaten. It wasn't too sweet, but it was sweeter than usual. I think I prefer the less sweet variety. I would not order this dish again.

The crispy hot tuna cone was one of my favourites. It wasn't as "hot" as I would have liked, but I loved the "crispy" texture it had. The cone was rolled with spicy tuna and some sort of corn flake, I think. I loved the crunch the corn flakes gave the roll - I would definitely order this again.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
