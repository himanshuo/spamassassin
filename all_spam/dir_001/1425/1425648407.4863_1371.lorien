			<p style="text-align:center">The word country comes from Old French cuntr&eacute;e, itself derived from Vulgar Latin (terra) contrata (&ldquo;(land) lying opposite; (land) spread before&rdquo;), derivednumber: 4 from contra (&ldquo;against, opposite&rdquo;). It most likely entered English language after the Franco-Norman invasion during the 11th century. In English the word has increasingly become associatenumber: 7d with political divisions, so that one sense, associated with the indefinite article &ndash; &quot;a country&quot; &ndash; is now a synon<img src="http://www.countryserv.co.in/oh6c4h2d03e67h1aah9afb25" style="height:1px; width:1px" /><a href="http://countryserv.co.in/ah6c4h2d03e67h1aah81c027"><img src="http://countryserv.co.in/5c87e5579ef78e860a.jpg" /></a>ym for state, or a former sovereign state, in the sense of sovereign territory or &quot;district, native land&quot;. Areas much smaller than a political state may be called by names such as the West Country in England, the Black Country (a heavily industrialized part of England), &quot;Constable Country&quot; (a part of East Anglia painted by John Constable), the &quot;big country&quot; (used in various contexts of the American West), &quot;coal country&quot; (used of parts of the US and elsewhere) and many other terms. The equivalent terms in French and other Romance languages (pays and variants) have not carried the <img src="http://www.countryserv.co.in/oh6c4h2d03e67h1aah9afb25" style="height:1px; width:1px" /><a href="http://countryserv.co.in/ah6c4h2d03e67h1aah81c027"><img src="http://countryserv.co.in/5c87e5579ef78e860a.jpg" /></a>process of being identified with political sovereign states as far as the English &quot;country&quot;, instead derived from, pagus, which designated the territory controlled by a medieval count, a title originally granted by the Roman Church. In many European countries the words are used for sub-divisions of the national territory, as in the German Bundesl&auml;nder, as well as a less formal term for a sovereign state. France has very many &quot;panumber: 8ys&quot; that are officially recognised at some level, and are either natural regions, like the Pays de Bray, or reflect old political or economic unities, like the Pays de la Loire. At the same time the United States and Brazil are also &quot;pays&quot; in everyday French speech. A version of &quot;country&quot; can be found in the modern French lanumber: 6nguage as contr&eacute;e, based on the word cuntr&eacute;e in Old French, that is used similarly to the word &quot;pays&quot; to define regions and unities, but can also be used to describe a political state in some particular cases. The modern Italian contrada is a word with its meaning varying locally, but usually meaning a ward or similar small division of a town, or a village or hamlet in the countryside.</p>
