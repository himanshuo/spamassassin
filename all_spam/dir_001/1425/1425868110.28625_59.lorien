Electronic Transaction Dispute=20
Dear client,

My name is Khushboo. We are writing you about your funds transfer.

Upon looking into your account I can see that a transfer was made on t=
he 22nd February, 2015 in the amount of $2,00.00 and we suspect that t=
he transfer was not initiated by you.

If you don't have initiated this transfer please follow the link below=
 to cancel the transaction.

Cancel Electronic Transfer

We will reverse and credit back your account if you decide to cancel t=
his transaction.

Electronic payments made using incorrect account details will do one o=
f three things.

1. The payment will be accepted into the correct account given the acc=
ount number is correct.
2. The payment will be rejected and will be returned to your account w=
ithin 4 business days and the transfer will need to be actioned again.=

3. The payment will be credited to an incorrect account, whereby it wi=
ll be necessary for us to lodge a dispute on your behalf to regain the=
 funds.

Yours Sincerely,

Khushboo Paliwal
Online Service Advisor=20
