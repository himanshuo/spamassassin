Well, we pass by Bao Dim Sum House all 200150143042 time and we wondered how it would be like. From 200150143042 outside, it looked really posh, with red lighting and expensive looking decor. 200150143042 vibe reminded us of Geisha House. We peeked in and we we didn't see a single Asian eating 200150143042re nor rolling carts at 9pm on a Friday night. We checked out 200150143042ir menu outside and saw that 200150143042y had an amazing happy hour from 11-3pm and again from 5-7pm every day for $1.99 drafts, $4 wines, $5 large hot sake, $2.95 dim sum, $4 mimosas on 200150143042 weekend. We were a second away from crossing 200150143042 street to Jar when we decided to peek in and see what time 200150143042y closed. 200150143042y said 200150143042y were serving until 10:30pm. We looked at each o200150143042r and shrugged why not. We'll always be curious if we don't, and we probably won't make it out for happy hour for at least ano200150143042r month because of our busy schedules. So we sat, with completely low expectations and because I'm only eating seafood right now (giving up meat for lent) we picked 200150143042 bok choy and shrimp dumpling, 200150143042 crispy taro balls, 200150143042 radish pancakes (ate around 200150143042 pork), walnut and honey prawns, and I got 200150143042 bao's version of an old fashioned and my hubz got 200150143042 mojito with ginger in it. Which dim sum place can you go to in 200150143042 middle of 200150143042 night and have it with cocktails? That's what I'm saying! You get about 4 pieces per order and 200150143042y are perfect two-bite sizes. If you go during select times for lunch and/or happy hour its super cheap-- most dim sum is about 2.95 or 3.95. As for 200150143042 service it's fantastic. I had my birthday party here and it wasn't crowded or loud. I made it a point to come during Happy Hour and 200150143042y were nice enough to take some last minute orders before it ended. 200150143042y were friendly, helpful and so accomodating, especially to my guests who have never had dim sum before. Parking can kind of be tricky but 200150143042re's valet if you arent lucky enough to get a spot.
