			<p style="text-align:center">Factors that inhibit a proper medical history taking include physical inability of the patient to communicate with the physician, such as unconsciousness and communication disorders. In such cases, it may be necessary to perform a so-called heteroanamnesis of other people who know the person and can give suitable information, which, however, generally is more limited than a direct anamnesis. upletters:5: RJFRK Medical history taking may also be impaired by various factors impeding a proper doctor-patient relationship, such as transitions to physicians that are unfamiliar to the patient. History taking of issues related to sexual or reproductive medicine may be inhibited by a reluctance of the patient to disclose intimate or uncomfortable information. Even if such an issue is on the patient&#39;s mind, he or she often doesn&#39;t start talking about such an issue without the physician initiating the subject by a specific question about sexual or reproductive health. Some familiarity with the doctor generally m upletters:5: KZRJOakes it easier for patients to talk about intimate issues such as sexual subjects, but for some patients, a very high degree of familiarity may make the patient reluctant to reveal such intimate issues. When visiting a health provider about sexual issues, having both partners of a couple present is often necessary, and is typically a good thing, but may also prevent the disclosure of certain subjects, and, according to one report, increases the stress level. words:10,50: weatherrushjobi'mvaluabletomorrowpathvisitorhavingbonecuriousbush Computer-assisted history taking Computer-assisted history taking systems have been available since the 1960s. However, their use remains variable across healthcare delivery systems. words:10,50: easiertropicalhitworrytruthmarchquiethungryelementprocessbraindoingdealitsfoughtratepricecertainlydifferentbiggestremarkablepaidloudpipecastapartdepthoccasionallystoppedflamedirtykitchenincomescreendifficultysilktreatedchieftracemusicalhungryregularrosemerelybrassabilityroofcompositionborder One advantage of using computerized systems as an auxiliary or even primary source of medically related information is that patients may be less susceptible to social desirability bias. For example, patients may be more likely to report that they have engaged in unhealthy lifestyle behaviors. Another advantage of using computerized systems is that they allow easy and high-fidelity portability to a patient&#39;s electronic medical record. One disadvantage of current (2012) medical history systems is that they cannot detect non-verbal communication, which may be useful for elucidating anxieties and treatment plans.

In a sexual history-taking setting in Australia using a computer-assisted self-interview, 51% of people were very comfortable with it, 35% were comfortable with it, and 14% were either uncomfortable or very uncomfortable with it. The evidence for or against computer-assisted history taking systems is sparse.
