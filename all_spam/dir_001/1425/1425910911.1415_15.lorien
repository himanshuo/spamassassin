<p align="center">increase the production of wealth. Now, for the production of wealth, two things are required—labor and land. Therefore, the effect of labor-saving  JOG 
improvements will be to extend the demand for land, and wherever the limit of the quality of land in use is reached, to bring into cultivation lands  SCWPQF 
of f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 less natural productiveness, f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 or f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 to extend cultivation on the same lands to a point of lower natural f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 productiveness. And thus, while the primary 
effect of labor-saving improvements is to increase the power of labor, the secondary effect is to extend cultivation, and, DIBY where this lowers the 
margin of cultivation, to increase rent. Thus, where land is entirely appropriated, f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 as in England, or where it is either appropriated or f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 is 
capable of appropriation as f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 FFFFHXS rapidly as it is needed for use, as in the United States, the ultimate effect of labor-saving machinery WUU or improvements f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 is to increase rent without increasing wages or interest. </p>
<BR /><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 9px; color: #ffffff;"></span>
<p align="left" style="font: 16px;">It is important that this f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 be fully understood, for it<u>shows that effects attributed by current theories to f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 increase of</u>population are really due to 
the progress of invention, and explains the otherwise perplexing fact that labor-saving machinery everywhere falls to benefit DULT laborers. </p>
<BR />
<p align="center" style="font: 15px;">Yet, fully to grasp this truth, it is necessary to keep in mind SSFF EULWYKOQ what I have already more than once adverted to—the interchangeability of wealth. I 
refer to this again, only because it is so persistently forgotten or ignored by writers who speak of agricultural production as though it were  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 </p>
<BR /><BR /><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 8px; color: #ffffff;"></span>
<p align="center">to be distinguished from production in general, and of food or subsistence as though it were not included in the term wealth. Let me ask the reader to bear QUBTVGYBO in mind, what has already been sufficiently 
ilhirated, that the possession or production of any form of wealth is virtually the possession or production of any other form f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 of wealth for 
which it will exchange—in order<I>that he may clearly see that it is not merely improvements which effect a saving in labor directly</I>applied to land  IYJ </p>
<BR /><span style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif, Times New Roman, Arial; font-size: 9px; color: #ffffff;"></span>
<p>that tend to increase rent, but all improvements that in any way save labor. That the labor of any individual is applied exclusively to the production  HTEMRRJ 
of one form of wealth is solely the result of the division of labor. The object of labor on the part of any individual is not the obtainment of  MNORRLF 
wealth f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 in one particular form, RLQICJD but the obtainment of wealth in all the forms that consort with his desires. f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 And, hence, an improvement which 
effects a saving in the labor required to produce FDYL one of the things desired, is, in effect, EBA an f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 increase OCMX in the power of producing all the other 
things. If WQLQLWD it take half a man’s YLUQA labor to keep CKLSTPCY him in food, and the other half to provide him clothing and shelter, an improvement which would 
increase his power of producing food would also increase his power of providing clothing and shelter. If his desires for more or better food, and  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
for more or better clothing and shelter, were equal, an improvement in one UHYINCLCG department of labor would be precisely equivalent to a like improvement in 
the other. If the improvement consisted in a doubling of the power of his labor in f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 producing food, XDFQQVC he would NBBB give one-third less labor to the .</p>
