I don't want you to feel sorry for me because I believe everyone will die someday. My name is Mrs. Jennifer Arnold a dying woman of 58 years old I have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer.&nbsp; I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the Oman, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.</FONT></DIV>

<FONT face="Times New Roman">I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan; they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them, this is my reason for writing and making the following proposal to you I took this decision because I have no child that will inherit this funds. </FONT></DIV>
