It lies at an elevation of 118 feet 36 m. Dr. A. B. Nobles House and McKendree Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.The Sitwell Baronetcy, of Renishaw in the County of Derby, is a title in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 3 October 1808 for Sitwell Sitwell, Member of Parliament for West Looe. The Sitwell family had been ironmasters and landowners in Eckington, Derbyshire, for many centuries.In 1625, George Sitwell 16001667, High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1653, built Renishaw Hall, which remains the family seat. The family were to inherit the titles of two other families Sacheverell, which died out in 1726, and Reresby, whose heiress married George Sitwell's grandson. George Sitwell's greatgreatgrandson Francis Hurt Sitwell 17281793, father of the first baronet, inherited Barmoor Castle, Northumberland. He was born Francis Hurt, the son of Jonathan Hurt and his wife Katherine Sitwell, heiress of the Sitwell family, and assumed the surname of Sitwell in lieu of his patronymic. The fourth baronet sat as Conservative Member of Parliament for Scarborough. His sons, the fifth and sixth baronets, were both noted poets and authors. Dame Edith Sitwell, his only daughter, was a poet and critic. The seventh Baronet was High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1983 and a Deputy Lieutenant of the county. As of 28 February 2014 the present Baronet has not successfully proven his succession and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage, with the baronetcy considered dormant since 2009.
