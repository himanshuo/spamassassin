One day I'm gonna break the guys that work here. They may think they are the rudest business in Austin but I'll continue being overly polite. I'll even offer them a hug next time. That'll show them.

What has been said about this food truck has already been said 100 times. This place is freaking good. Their fried monte cristo is hands down (well hands holding the sandwich) delicious. Even without their raspberry sauce that you want to slather over your morning toast, this sandwich is party in your stomach.

If you can, find a day where the sun shining since the outdoor eating area complements a beautiful day. My only complaint: I wish I ordered another serving of their homemade chips. Damn, those are good too...f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
