<p>will be a very powerful reason for adopting labour [207] as the practical measure of value, even among those who may persevere YYGJD in thinking that the </p>
<BR>
<p align="right">best definition ETN of f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 value in exchange is the general power of purchasing. f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 To those, however, who hold the opinion that the variations in the 
exchangeable value of a<u>commodity and the variations in its power of purchasing are NMFUT not identical, and that a commodity increases in exchangeable value only when it will command</u>a greater value in exchange, 
while its power of purchasing may increase merely because it will command a greater quantity f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 of commodities which JCOXHBDO have confessedly fallen in EPGULU value, the </p>
<BR>
<p align="center" style="font: 14px;">reasons for adopting labour as the measure of value will be found to increase tenfold in force. There are various ways of describing value f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 in the sense here understood; </p>
<BR><BR><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Courier New, Times New Roman, Arial; font-size: 8px; color: #ffffff;"></span>
<p align="center">and the slightest examination of them RKIF will show that the labour which a commodity will command can alone be the measure of such value. First; The author of the Critical Dissertation on Value has commenced his 
work KHOVMSQ by a description of it, in which I entirely agree with him. He says, as I have before stated, that â€œvalue, in its ultimate sense, appears to 
[208] mean the esteem in which any object is held. But it is obvious that the degree of this esteem cannot be measured by comparing it with another  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
commodity about which we know as little as of the first. The comparison with hi would f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 leave us as much in the dark as ever, if AIFGEAR we did not 
previously<i>know the estimation in which hi was held.* even the mere relative values of two commodities cannot be inferred by putting them side  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047</i>
by side, and looking at them for any length of time. Before we can attain even this partial conclusion, we must refer each of them to the desires of  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
man, and the means of production; that is, we IQR must make a previous comparison, in order to ascertain the f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 value of each before we can venture 
to say what relation one bears to the other. It is this primary comparison which, independently [209] of any secondary comparison, determines the  PSUGYMNV 
estimation in AIOLQVXB which the commodity is held. And as this primary comparison can only be represented by the exchange with labour, it is certain that, if 
we define the value f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 of a commodity to be the estimation in which it is held, the quantity of labour which it will command can alone measure this </p>
<BR><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 10px;"></span>
<p align="right" style="font: 11px;">estimation. Secondly: Locke, most justly looking to the foundation of f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 all value, considers the value of commodities as determined by the proportion of their 
quantity to their vent, or of the supply to the demand; but the varying vent or demand for one commodity cannot possibly be represented by the  KVPFOQOUY 
varying quantity of another commodity for which it is exchanged, unless the second commodity remain steady in regard to labour. If at one time I give  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
two pounds of hops for a yard of cloth, and at another time only one, it does not at all follow that the demand for cloth has diminished; on the  UUQFN 
contrary, it may be increased, and in giving f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 the value of one pound of hops, I may have enabled the cloth manufacturer to set more men to work, 
and to [210] obtain higher profits than when I gave the value of two pounds. But the demand for a commodity, though not KUIGDJUQG VYWJ proportioned to the .</p>
