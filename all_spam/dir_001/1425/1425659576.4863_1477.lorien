			<br />
			If you have federal student loans, you may be able to consolidate your loans and save money. You must have federal student loans to qualify and already be out of school. Best of all, your payments are based on your current income and after 300 payments (120 for civil servants) your debt is forgiven (and it doesn&#39;t hurt your credit).<br />
			<br />
			Check out the benefits of consolidation:<br />
			<br />
			Payments Based on Income (As Low as $0)<br />
			<br />
			Payments Deferred for 90 Days While We Consolidate Your Loan<br />
			<br />
			Fixed Number of Payments, Any Remaining Balance is Forgiven (300 Max Payments or 120 for Civil Servants)<br />
