It is not caused by damage or disease of the nervous system. Patients with functional weakness experience symptoms of limb weakness which can be disabling and frightening such as problems walking or a heaviness down one side, dropping things or a feeling that a limb just doesnt feel normal or part of them. Functional weakness may also be described as 'dissociative motor disorder' and less helpfully as "conversion disorder."To the patient and the doctor it often looks as if there has been a stroke or have symptoms of multiple sclerosis. However, unlike these conditions, with functional weakness there is no permanent damage to the nervous system which means that it can get better or even go away completely.To the patient and the doctor it often looks as if there has been a stroke or have symptoms of multiple sclerosis.
