she  z1pbygnx2  left the castle, and went towards  the  bygn0x2    bygn0x2  quay  where  the  boat  lay,   Roland  Graeme, anxious to communicate with her if possible,  n0x2    threw  z1pbygnx2   himself  in  her  way,   and  might  have 


succeeded in exchanging a few words with  ygn0x2   her,   as  she  was  guarded  only  bygn0x2   by  the   dejected Chamberlain and his halberdiers, but she seemed to have taken, in its  most  strict  and  literal 


acceptation, the  z1pbygnx2  command to be silent which she had received from the Queen; for,   to  the repeated signs of her grandson, she only replied  by   n0x2  laying   bygn0x2  her  finger  on  her 


lip. Dr. Lundin was not so reserved. Regret for  z1pbygnx2  the handsome  gratuity,   and  for  the compulsory task of self-denial imposed on him,  had  grieved  the  spirit  of  that  worthy 


officer and learned mediciner â€” â€œEven thus, my friend, â€  said  he,   squeezing  the  page's hand as he  bygn0x2  bade him farewell, â€œis merit rewarded. I came  z1pbygnx2  to cure this unhappy  Lady   bygn0x2  â€”  and  I 


profess she well deserves  gn0x2  the trouble, for, say what they will of her,  she  hath  a  most winning manner, a sweet voice, a gracious smile, and a most  majestic  wave  of  her  hand. 


If she was not poisoned, say, my dear MasterRoland, was that fault of mine,  I  being  ready to cure her if she had?â€” andnow I am denied the   ygn0x2  permission   bygn0x2  to  accept  my  well-earned 


honorarium â€” O Galen! O Hippocrates! is the  graduate's  cap  and  doctor's  scarlet brought to this phi! frustra fatigamus remediis aegros! â€   bygn0x2  


He wiped his eyes, stepped on the  gunwale,   and  the  boat pushed off from the shore, and went merrily across the lake,  n0x2    which  was  dimpled  by  the 


summer wind. 32 32 A romancer, to use a  1pbygn02  Scottish phrase, wants  but  a   gn0x2  hair to make a tether of. The whole detail of the  steward's  supposed  conspiracy  against  bygn0x2   the 


life of Mary,is grounded upon an expression in one of her letters,  which  affirms,    1pbygn02  that Jasper Dryfesdale, one of the Laird of Lochleven's servants,  had  threatened  to  murder 


William Douglas, (for his share in the Queen's escape,) and averred that he  would  plant  a dagger in Mary's own heart.â€” Chalmer's  Life  of  Queen  Mary  ,   vol.   i.   p.    278.   bygn0x2  



Death  distant?â€”  3z1pbyg0x2   No,   alas!    he's    ever    with    us, And  shakes  the  dart  at  us  in    all    our  gn0x2     actings:  z1pbygnx2  He  lurks  within  bygn0x2   our  cup,   while   3z1pbyg0x2  we're    in    health; 



Sits  by   our   3z1pbyg0x2    sick-bed,       mocks    our  bygn0x2     medicines; We  cannot  walk,   or  sit,   or  ride,       or    travel, But  Death  is  by  to   seize    us    z1pbygnx2   when  n0x2     he    lists. 



The Spanish Father . From the agitating scene in  the  Queen's   z1pbygnx2  presence-chamber, the Lady of Lochleven retreated to her  n0x2   bygn0x2  own apartment,   and  ordered  the  steward 


to be called before her.  n0x2  â€œHave they not  ygn0x2  disarmed thee,  Dryfesdale?â€  she  said,   on seeing him enter, accoutred,  gn0x2  as usual, with sword and dagger.
