An completely new strategy to bank is exploding all around the world.
 
It's absolutely independent of the government as well as the primary banking system.
 
I consider it the "underground banking method."
 
Understandably, Wall Street, the Fed as well as Congress are freaking out about the benefits this is offering people.
 
Not only are folks obtaining an unparalleled degree of privacy and security - those who have stayed with it had the possibility to produce as much as 5,000% on their investment.

The sea floor of the bight consists largely of continental shelf and includes the Hudson Canyon, an undersea Pleistocene submarine canyon, which was formed by the Hudson River during the ice ages, when the sea level was lower. The bight includes major shipping channels that access New York Harbor. The coastal climate of the gulf is temperate as the result of direct contact from the Gulf Stream along the coast of North America.The geography of the bight is such that the coast makes a nearly right angle bend at the mouth of the Hudson. This feature has long been of major concern to meteorologists in the study of tropical storm patterns along the east coast, and is one of the primary reasons why the New York Metropolitan Area is considered a high danger zone for storm generated oceanwater surges, despite its northerly latitude. Specifically, in the presence of a hurricane off the coast of New Jersey, the easterly cyclonic winds along the northern edge of the storm could drive a strong surge to the west, laterally along the southern coast of Long Island and straight into Lower New York Bay. The angle bend of the New Jersey coast would leave little outlet for the surge, leading to widespread flooding throughout New York City, especially along the southern coast of Staten Island and Manhattan storm surges of up to 30 feet 9.1160m were reported in the hurricane of 1893. The New York Bight Apex is the area including and between the Hudson River estuary and the Raritan River estuary extending 67160km of the coast and includes Raritan Bay and Lower New York Bay.
