Good morning,

I am Eugenia from Petrozavodsk, Russia; an IT specialist by profession =
andbelong to an upper middle class family.
Both my parents are engineers and theyhave brought me up in a liberal =
way giving enough freedom for my thoughts andactions.
Many have criticized them for that, but in my case, it did me only =
goodand I grew up to be a free thinking, liberal yet well-mannered and =
establishedin life individual.
Only thing lacking in my life is the need of a loving lifepartner.
My life is so busy in the computer labs of my software firm that =
Idon=92t get time to mingle up with others in night clubs and other =
social eventslike my friends.
So I was left behind in personal life.Then I came through this premium =
dating and friendship website whose primary aimis to make suitable =
people meet each other and make a family of their own.
Though yet I haven=92t met my love here, I am fully satisfied with this =
website asit has given me some exposure as to what I am to expect in the =
future.
I havemade many new friends both girls and men and now I have a clear =
idea on whatsort of a man I want in my life.
