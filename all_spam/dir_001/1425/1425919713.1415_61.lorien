An thoroughly cutting edge strategy to bank is exploding over the world.
 
It's absolutely independent of the regulators as well as the central banking program.
 
I call it the "underground banking system."
 
Of course, Wall Street, the Fed as well as Congress are freaking out about the benefits this is offering people.
 
Not only are individuals obtaining an unprecedented level of privacy and security - those who have stayed with it had the ability to earn as much as 5,000% on their investment.

This place is definitely a great find in Charlotte. We came here for the first time on a Monday night, 3/2/15. We had heard the raving reviews from friends and reviews, so we gave it a try. We had a couple drinks and ordered the Scallops, Pork Bun, Shrimp & Andouille Risotto, Roasted Duck Gnocchi, and Quail. I give the gnocchi, scallops, and pork bun 5 stars! The gnocchi was our fave... the duck was awesome, the gnocchi was cooked perfectly, and the sauce is fantastic! And the portion was very generous for a small plate. Scallops with the grits were also fantastic. Pork bun was nice and big and the Asian flavors with the slaw were great! However, the quail was a bit underwhelming because it was kind of like a quail "chicken" fried tender. I would definitely skip next time. The shrimp & andouille risotto was also underwhelming... I think the risotto may have been overcooked and was bland IMO. 

The service was a bit slow, but the waiter explained that they were unusually busy for a Monday night. I will definitely be back! 4 stars b/c the food that was good was REALLY REALLY good.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
