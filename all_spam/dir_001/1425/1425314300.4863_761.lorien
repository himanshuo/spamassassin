Anyway, the restaurant is a 10 minute drive from downtown on Canal street.  If you hit Lockwood, you have gone too far.  Don't be scared-off by the outside appearance...it blends-in with the neighborhood.

It's a small place, very clean and basic.  Order and pay, then grab a table.  Silverware is in the corner and a small selection of soft drinks are in a cooler.  A muted TV was on and music was playing through a speaker.  Very comfortable.

We ordered three different appetizers to start: Ho Cakes (love that name), Fried Okra, and Turkey Neck Lettuce Wraps.  We wanted to try the boudin appetizer, but two of the three meats were out.  The Ho Cakes were good and had a slight spiciness to them.  I didn't think too much of the fried okra, but I am not a big okra fan anyway.  The okra had a fish-fry cornbread batter, but not much spice/taste to it.  My friend had the same breading on a fried green tomato that I tried, and I thought it was ok as well.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
