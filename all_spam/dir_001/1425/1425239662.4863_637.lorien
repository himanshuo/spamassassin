We came here for seafood and we had a better than fantastic meal. As a professional fisherman I know fish,  the superb quality of everything we ate reflected the 5 star service of the staff. Before coming to the Blue Point Grill we did our homework and studied the menu, right away some interesting dishes beckoned a taste. The buffalo calamari is something anyone should try once in their lives. The grilled octopus literally changed my whole outlook about how octopus can taste,  especially the texture. If you were ever squeamish about eating octopus get over it because you are missing out. 

The raw bar menu is terrific, a great selection of oyster from up and down the North East coast and a couple of special picks from the West. It is a little expensive but the staff is on hand to make you feel like a real connoisseur by giving a detailed description of each. 

The main dining area lacks elbow room but the food will take you to another world!f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
