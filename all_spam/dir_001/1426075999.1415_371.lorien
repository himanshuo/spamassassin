Celebrated my sister in laws birthday and our 3rd baby announcement...couldn't of asked for a more perfect setting. The ambience was that of a Vegas scene-- music was popping and so were the bottles. Steaks are top quality, very flavorful and perfectly cooked. I ordered the bone-in ribeye, medium with a chard on the outside; my wife the fillet, sister and brother in law, the new your strip and ribeye as well . Our steaks were so hot that we had to let them sit a little while before we could begin eating-- this is a good thing. I don't know 'bout you Pedro, but not a fan of cold steaks.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">On Saturday, I had the opportunity to have dinner and celebrate my friend's RN promotion with my her and her family at Mastros. This was my second experience at this location and boy... Was it better than the very first time. We had reservations for the second floor. The ambiance was amazing. Despite not really being able to see the person sitting next to or across from you, it was still very nice. The crowd was mixed and the volume of enjoyment varied from medium-high to very-high. The band played all kinds of old school soulful jams. All they needed was a dance floor and I promise I would've tore that dance floor up. 

Anyways... THIS TIME, I went with a group who weren't just trying to "do it for the gram!" No pictures of the menu or the food were taken. No one ONLY ordered an appetizer or salad. Everyone enjoys a full course meal. I ordered the crab cakes, a caesar salad, and a twice baked potato. It was AMAZING!!! I definitely got my money's worth. I made sure I ate EVERYTHING on my plate including the horseradish and greenery on the plate with my crab cakes. Talk about mouth watering and satisfying. 

The other popular things to order at the table were the following:
1. Saut??ed Shrimp
2. The complimentary bread!!!
3. The lobster potatoes
4. The sweet corn
5. The creamy spinach
6. Garlic potatoes

Did I mention how amazing the food was? Did I mention just how much more better my second experience was compared to the very first time? You have to make sure that you go with people who are willing to spend more than $60-70 on their meal. Lot you don't have enough to eat a meal and tip the waiter and have something other than water.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
