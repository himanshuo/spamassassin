The overall experience was definitely not worth it.  Reading the other reviews, I'm sure their other selections that were not on the DineLA options were good.  However, what they put aside for DineLA was disappointing.  Almost all the dishes were bland, not well cooked, and the flavor was just not there.  On top of that, the wait for food was incredibly long.  It was so much time in between each plate that we just lost our appetite waiting.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047.

Although we had reservations at 8:15 pm, we still had to wait about 15 minutes for our table.  Not a big deal at all, but they don't really have a good area to wait in, so everyone was crowded around the host stand. It's amazing how crowded Da Pasquale was on a Monday night when all the restaurants surrounding it were totally empty.  Judging from the crowd, I'd imagine that they have a lot of local and regular clientele.

I was excited to try the fresh bread based on Brittany B's review that it was the best thing about Da Pasquale.  It was piping hot and they pour olive oil and balsamic vinegar on each person's plate to dip it in.  It was very good, but I think my expectations might have been a bit high as it wasn't amazing like the bread at Petit Trois.
