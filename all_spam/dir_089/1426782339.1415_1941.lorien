The kale salad was good. I wish there had been more interesting ingredients added to it (I dunno, like pomegranate seeds or something!) but it was rather plain, mixed in with cabbage and topped with chopped peanuts. It was a small appetizer to share with other person so I recommend keeping one to yourself. 

The veggie burger was alright. It was rather bland but better than a Gardenburger. 

Fried were excellent and he best thing we ordered! Fresh!

The burger was a disappointment. For a place known for its burger I was surprised the waitress didn't ask how I wanted it cooked. I spoke up and asked for medium but I revived my burger well done. The burger itself lacked flavor so I was glad it came with a generous topping of cole slaw. The burger crumbled apart and was just very mediocre.
