The village lies approximately 14 miles 23160km southwest of Cambridge and 3 miles 4.8160km northwest of Royston."The Handicapped" is a science fiction short story written in 1967 by Larry Niven, set in the Known Space universe. The story introduces the Grogs the sessile but sentient inhabitants of the planet known as Down.Mr Garvey arrives at the planet Down, having heard about the natives called Grogs. Garvey Limited, a company owned by his father, makes artificial limbs and other tools for the "Handicapped" species sentient beings that evolved minds but with nothing that would serve as hands, like dolphins. A local reluctantly agrees to show him a living Grog in the desert, but the Grog turns out to be a disappointment. It is sessile enough, being a furry cone living anchored to a rock, but it seems utterly void of sentience. The latter observation is later confirmed by a local exobiologist.Mr Garvey arrives at the planet Down, having heard about the natives called Grogs.
