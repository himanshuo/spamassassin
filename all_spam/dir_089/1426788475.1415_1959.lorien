For a special occasion birthday dinner, Seasonal Pantry can't be beat. You can get great food all over the city, but the experience of sitting around 1 table, ooohing and aghhhing the same culinary surprises with a mix of 12 friends and strangers + the chef (while passers-by gaze jealously in the front window) was truly unique, and made for a more memorable night than waiting in line for 3 hours at the flavor-of-the-month DC restaurant fad.
