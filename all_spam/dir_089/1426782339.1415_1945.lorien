It was released by Music Club on 16 July 2007 in the United Kingdom. The album contains every song from Minogue's two Deconstruction Records albums Kylie Minogue 1994 and Impossible Princess 1997, as well as rare songs and Bsides.Butovskaya Line Russian  , IPA160[butfskj linj] is a line of the Moscow Metro.The line represents an experiment in building rapidtransit in areas where tunnel boring is considered expensive and impractical. In the past, attempts were made to build lines at ground level, however as the Filyovskaya Line showed, harsh Russian winters and the occupation of the large amount of useful land, make such projects impractical. However, new districts on the very edge of the city, particularly those outside the Moscow Automobile Ring Road MKAD required a rapidtransit connection. As the practicality of tunnel boring is unclear, the system was planned to be above ground since the late 1980s, when Moscow Metro design bureau, Metrogiprotrans, developed a set of projects that would bring rapidtransit beyond MKAD, with the Yuzhnoye Butovo District being the first one.The line represents an experiment in building rapidtransit in areas where tunnel boring is considered expensive and impractical.
