 hair.

The Topaz solar project in San Luis Obispo County, Calif. =E2=80=94 which, =
like Desert Sunlight, was built by Arizona-based First Solar =E2=80=94 also=
 has a capacity of 550 megawatts. But the desert has more abundant sunlight=
 than San Luis Obispo County, so Desert Sunlight will actually generate mor=
e electricity than Topaz, said Georges Antoun, First Solar's chief operatin=
g officer.

"It's a beautiful sun here, year-round," he said.

California as a whole has installed more renewable energy than any other st=
ate, noted David Hochschild, a member of the California Energy Commission.

"There were a lot of skeptics who actually didn't believe that renewables c=
ould scale, that this cost reduction could happen, that we could introduce =
it to the grid," Hochschild said. "They've been proven wrong."

There's little doubt that California will get more electricity from clean e=
nergy in the coming years. The state's three major utilities are on track t=
o meet or exceed a 33% renewable energy mandate by 2020, and Gov. Jerry Bro=
wn is calling for policymakers to increase that target to 50% by 2030.

It's an open question, though, whether future solar projects will be anywhe=
re near as big as Desert Sunlight.

Developers have been gravitating toward smaller solar farms, which are easi=
er to build and usually have a smaller impact on species and ecosystems in =
California's deserts. Desert Sunlight spans 3,800 acres near Joshua Tree Na=
tional Park, and it faced vehement opposition from environmental activists =
during its permitting process.

If legislators adopt a 50% renewable energy mandate, it could incentivize m=
assive projects like Desert Sunlight. But Antoun said he'd be surprised to =
see many more projects 550 megawatts or larger, in California or elsewhere.

"Can we create a bigger project? Of course," he said. "But it all has to do=
 with how much appetite (states) have for how much land to utilize, and to =
be committed for 20-25 years."

Utilities faced with renewable energy mandates, Antoun said, will more like=
ly turn to projects in the 100-megawatt range, located closer to energy con=
sumers. Projects built near cities require far less transmission infrastruc=
ture, which is expensive to build anses concerns about whether some retaile=
rs will keep accepting the company's cards. Yet American Express still has =
