What a great local spot. The actual place is on the small side but they do have a lot more seating outside, great for those good weather days. They have a TV inside, for those sports enthusiast. I have dined in yet, only picked up and had delivered. The pizzas tried have been good, I enjoy their crust, not factory processed. The only pasta tried so far is chicken alfredo, it's ok, nothing special but it's not bad either. My favorite is the veggie calzone, so flavorful! The downside is that it can be a little too juicy and gets the bottom a little soggy, but once you bit in and the yummy juices run down your hand, you don't care much. 

They have gellato, I have seen several people order it while I was waiting for my food but have not tried it yet myself. It's on the menu for the first time I dine in.
