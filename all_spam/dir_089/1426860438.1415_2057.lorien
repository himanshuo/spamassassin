My grandmother lives around the corner from here and I have, quite literally, grown up on the biltong.  I was born & raised in New York but visited LA 1-2x per year since childhood.  Without fail, after I said hello to my Grandma, I would immediately walk over to the Sausage Kitchen for my biltong fix.  I have bought biltong to take with me on travel  all over the world and on cross country road trips.  My 13 cousins, whom grew up everywhere from LA to New Mexico to Illinois to New York, all have the same story. This place is a big part of our lives!
