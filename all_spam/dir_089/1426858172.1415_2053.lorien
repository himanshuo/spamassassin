While local theatres, most of them amateur, existed in American towns and cities prior to the Movement, it was this development that laid the foundation for today's network of regional theatres of comparable and often superior professional quality and artistic vision to that found in New York City.Zeigler presents the history of how it came to be that there are professional theatres throughout the country that constitute "an alternative to the theatre on Broadway."
