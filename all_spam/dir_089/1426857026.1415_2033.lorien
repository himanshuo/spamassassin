The restaurant itself is small so it makes sense they rely on reservation, the bar was tucked away in the corner with a TV. It's nice that there's a slight wall partition between the bar and dining area though. This place is a great restaurant for a date or with family. The decor and candles everywhere give it a nice romantic and intimate vibe. The lighting is dim which is nice to keep the mood set although it does get loud. 
The service was very hands off and laid back which is fine with me since they checked in on the food and if we needed more drinks.
