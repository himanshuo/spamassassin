This location is located off of 59 near the movie theater in Lakewood Church. They have an limited parking right outside the door due to space with the other businesses however there are more parking spots on the opposite side where you can park in any of those spots without being towed.

Whenever I entered there were people already dining and having good conversation. Whenever I walked up to the counter I was greeted by a nice young lady with a beautiful smile. I told her that it was my first time there and that I had no idea what to choose. I wasn't too much in the mood for a salad but the picture on the wall with the waffle with fruit looks very good to me.
