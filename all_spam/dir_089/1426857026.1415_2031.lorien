<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">With about three hours to spare till boarding my flight, alone and at the airport on my birthday, I thought, "Hey, why not?" and decided to treat myself to this highly acclaimed restaurant. And boy, oh boy, was it a treat.

I was seated immediately at a high top near the entrance and although my server took an unexpectedly long time to greet me, the service after that was on par. I started off with a Georgia Bellini. This drink is delicious, and you can really taste all the flavors in every sip. I hardly ever like a drink so much, but this was simple and delicious-- so delicious that, for dessert, I enjoyed a second glass.

On to the food! Having trouble deciding and wanting to try everything, I asked my server for advice. I narrowed down my choices to the Kamikaze roll + seared scallops or the salmon hot pot. He advised the salmon hot pot is "extraordinary" and well, since it's my birthday, I can't have anything short of extraordinary, right?

The salmon hot pot took a while to arrive, but once I took a bite, heavenly sensations soared throughout my body. I mean, the very first bite was delectable, and then...another, and another bite of heaven. This dish was so damn good that I ended up texting several people during my meal just to share my fondness.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
