Briswil is a municipality in the district of BernMittelland in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.Teinturier, a French language term meaning to dye or stain, is a wine term applied to grapes whose flesh and juice is red in colour due to anthocyanin pigments accumulating within the pulp of the grape berry itself. In most cases, anthocyanin pigments are confined to the outer skin tissue only, and the squeezed grape juice of most darkskinned grape varieties is clear. The red color of red wine comes from anthocyanins extracted from the macerated crushed skins, over a period of days during the fermentation process.Teinturier varieties, while containing a lot of color, usually make poor wines, perhaps due to a higher level of tannins, compounds structurally related
