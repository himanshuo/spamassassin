Ms Marylyn Demerey,
London, England.
Email:mdgold_great@yahoo.com

Beloveth,

I am the above named person but now undergoing medical treatment in London,=
 England. I am married to Dr.David Demerey who worked with British Railway =
Commission in Chelsea England for over a decade before he died in 2006.We w=
ere married for fifteen years without a child. He died after a brief illnes=
s that lasted for two weeks. Before his death he made a vow to use his weal=
th for the down trodden and the less privileged in the society. Since his d=
eath I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home.W=
hen my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $25.5 Million (Twenty=
 Five Million  Five hundred thousand United States Dollars) in a Vault with=
 a Security/Finance House in UK.

Presently, this money is still with them there. Recently, my Doctor told me=
 that I would not last for the next 150 days due to cancer problem.

Though what disturbs me most is my stroke. Having known my condition I deci=
ded to donate this fund to an individual or better still a God fearing pers=
on who will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein. I wan=
t an individual that will use this to fund and provide succor to poor and i=
ndigent persons, orphanages, and above all those affected in the Tsunami in=
 far Asia.

I understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision bec=
ause I do not have any child that will inherit this money and my husband re=
latives are not inclined to helping poor persons and I do not want my husba=
nds hard earned money to be misused or spent in the manner in which my late=
 husband did not specify. I do not want a situation where this money will b=
e used in an ungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this bold decision=
. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am =
going to be in the bosom of the Almighty.

I do not need any telephone communication in this regard because of my heal=
th, and because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always.=
 I do not want them to know about this development. With God all things are=
 possible.As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of t=
he Security/Finance House in UK. I will also issue you a letter of authorit=
y that will empower you as the original beneficiary of this fund,through my=
 Lawyer. I want you to always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a l=
ife worthy of emulation. Whosoever that wants to serve the Almighty must se=
rve him with all his heart and mind and soul and also in truth.

Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply w=
ill give me room in sourcing for an individual for this same purpose.

Please assure me that you will act according to my specification herein.

Hoping to hear from you.

For full details, kindly reply this mail with your full name, address,occup=
ation, status and phone/mobile to my email address (mdgold_great@yahoo.com)

Thank you and may the Almighty bless you.

In Christ,
