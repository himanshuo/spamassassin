It is a 31.49160km urban electorate in Sydney's outer west, taking in the suburbs of Blacktown, Doonside and Marayong. There were 46,357 electors enrolled in the district as of the 2007 state election.Blacktown is known as a largely workingclass area, and as such, the electorate has tended to strongly support the Australian Labor Party, which has held the seat for all but three years since its inception. It was briefly marginal during the late 1950s, when longserving member John Freeman was forced into retirement after trying and failing to find a safer seat. Liberal Alfred Dennis won the seat in the 1959 election, but held it for only one term before Labor regained it. The seat has since reverted to its usual tendencies. The current member for Blacktown is John Robertson, former Opposition Leader. He stepped down as the Opposition Leader on 23 December 2014.Blacktown is known as a largely workingclass area, and as such, the electorate has tended to strongly support the Australian Labor Party, which has held the seat for all but three years since its inception.
