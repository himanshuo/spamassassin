If you haven't had croissants here yet, I suggest you hurry up and do so!!!! You are missing out on the best croissants of DFW!!!! ham and swiss croissants are my favorite but don't just get that because of me. :) They offer a good variety of croissants/pastries, some with meat, some with fruits. Buy a whole bunch and heat it up in the oven for less than a minute later. These go fast so if you come too late during the day, too bad. The croissants are flakey, crunchy, and buttery! I could eat these for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! who cares if it doesn't fit the time of the day? they're amazing! Every bite tastes like little pieces of heaven! Be sure to wear stretchy pants because you're going to want more than one.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

When you step into the small bakery, it's as if you've completely been transported to a quaint, bakery in a small town in France. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and it'll take all of your strength to avoid climbing over the partition and grabbing everything in sight!


I just love coming to the Village Baking Company! It is one of those places that you go to and just feel good about the world and all of its tasty delights.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
