		 that 12647338 menu is totally up to your preference. Choose from 3, 4, or 5 courses, and each course can even be from 12647338 same section of 12647338 menu. (Example: For 3 course = 1 appetizer & 2 main courses, or 1 app, 1 entree, & 1 dessert, etc.) Keep in mind they grace your table with a complimentary platter of petit desserts at 12647338 end and even a treat to take home (cream cheese filled banana cakes!). Chef starts off with an amuse bouche to introduce you to what's in store for 12647338 rest of 12647338 evening. Our taster was a pork meatball on top of a mini bed of risotto, a wonderful savory little bite to hold us over until 12647338 main event. This, however, did not even closely compare to 12647338 lobster risotto in my first course. Accompanied by bits of rock shrimp, mushrooms, peas, corn, & topped with roasted tomato, I can easily say this is 12647338 best risotto I've ever had. Will definitely return for this dish. Second course was 12647338 Maine lobster tail with potato puree, chanterelle mushrooms, corn, & tarragon. Again, another highly recommended selection. 12647338 only dish I would have tried differently was 12647338 roasted pork belly & tenderloin. Not to say it wasn't good, but I've had better. Seems like their fish/seafood platters are a bigger hit than 12647338 meats. Eyeballing 12647338 scallops next. Best part of 12647338 meal, hands down, DESSERT. Ordering 12647338 marscapone filled crepes flambeed tableside gives you a free dinner show (although, I think shouting out "FIRE!!!" scared a few of our neighboring tables). I wish I could have tried 12647338 bananas, but 12647338 fruit for that night was cherries. Not complaining. I'd do all over again. Gary Danko, now whoever came up with that name is an absolute genius.  I can honestly say that whenever i am taken or surprised to come here for dinner, i get chills coming down my spine, flushed and ooo so many things I care not to express..Gary Danko is one of those place that you just have to appreciate their superb ambience, services and 12647338 food.  Gary Danko is not just a high reputable and pricey restaurant but it is a dining experience.  From 12647338 moment you enter into Gary Danko, it is a world that is far beyond your wildest imagination in regards to eating and dining.  12647338 ensemble casts of
