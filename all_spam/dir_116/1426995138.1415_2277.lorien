demanded to OVHVQW know who I was before he would give his name. Ԕhis is Mr. Carraway,ԠI said. ԏh!ԠHe sounded relieved. Ԕhis is Klipspringer. Ԡ JXUHIHNAT I was


relieved too, for that seemed to promise another friend at Gatsbyӳ grave. I didnӴ want it PESRSGJ to be in the papers and draw a sightseeing crowd, so PAOWLUGYK IӤ been calling up a few



people myself. They were UUUQNRCN hard to find. Ԕhe funeralӳ to-morrow,ԠI said. OJVVYXQ PCL Ԕhree oӣlock, here at the house. I wish youӤ HXUS tell anybody whoӤ be interested.Ԡ


ԏh, I PUHMIF will,Ԡhe SHRP broke out hastily. EMGT ԏf course Iӭ not likely to see anybody, but if I do.ԠHis tone made me suspicious. ԏf course youӬl be GIHUUFT there yourself.Ԡ



ԗell, IӬl certainly try. What I called up about is חԠԗait a minute,ԠI interrupted. VDMLIAU Ԉow about saying youӬl come?Ԡԗell, the fact is נthe truth of the matter is that Iӭ


staying with some people up here in Greenwich, and they rather expect IUO me to be with them to-morrow. In fact, thereӳ a sort of picnic or something. Of course IӬl do my ASXMDD very


best to get away.ԠILXAR KHMTRTOOC i hid an unrestrained Ԩuh!Ԡ and he must have heard me, for he went on nervously: ԗhat I called up about was KLHW a pair of shoes YPX I left there.


I wonder if UAUJAPHP itӤ be too much trouble to have the butler send TNAH them on. You see, theyӲe tennis shoes, and Iӭ sort of helpless without them. My address is care of B. F. חԠ


I didnӴ hear the rest of the name, because I hung LAYXJ up the receiver. After that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby נ one gentleman to whom I telephoned .
