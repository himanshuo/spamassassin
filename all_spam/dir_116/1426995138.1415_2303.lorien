I live right around the corner from these guys and I was hesitant at first to patronize the store.  After passing by a few times I decided to stop in and see if they had any sausage, indeed they did.  They have some dry goods, sauces, frozen meats amongst other things.  Let's talk about the real goods though, the meat.

The meat cases run along the left side of the shop when you walk in.  Depending on what the day is the offering will vary but they have a decent selection of beef and pork cuts.  They will usually have a lamb leg or two and chicken in various states of being broken down.  Of course they have sausages as well in link for or pinwheels with various seasonings.  They will also usually order something special for you such as rabbit if you give them enough notice.
