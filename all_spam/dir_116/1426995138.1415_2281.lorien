I stopped in for a quick sampling of some of the beers offered at Banger Brewing.  Since a "flight" (four, 5 oz. pours) was only $8.00, I thought it was the best way to go.  Here's what I sampled:

El Hefe - You can instantly smell the jalape??o coming off the head, which is a very light one that dissipates quickly, so enjoy it while it lasts.  The beer starts like a hefeweizen and leaves a slight jalape??o heat on the back of your tongue to finish that disappears just as soon as your tongue picks it up.  This is a great beer if you like hefs and enjoy spicy things (I do).
