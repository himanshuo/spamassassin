About a half dozen flavor profiles are available and include Tahini Cucumber Feta, Chile Citrus BBQ, Buffalo Buttermilk Blue, Chipotle Mango Avocado, Apple Curry Peanut, Sweet Soy Sriracha, and Spiced Tomato Tzatziki. After a few visits, I've already tried them all and they are all good. The popular profiles are Chile Citrus BBQ and Chipotle Mango Avocado.

I normally like to order a chicken rice bowl at Chipotle, so it's hard for me to not compare Gusto to Chipotle. The most noticeable difference between the two businesses is in the taste of the meat. Unlike Chipotle, Gusto's chicken has been wood-grilled so the meat sports a bit of char on the outer edges and its flavor is distinctly smokier. This also results in comparatively drier and chewier meat, but not in a bad way. It's different.
