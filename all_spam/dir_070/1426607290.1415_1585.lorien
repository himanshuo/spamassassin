Microcompounding refers to the mixing or processing of polymer formulations in the melt on a very small scale, typically several ml. The advantage of the use of a microcompounder for RampD are significant it gives faster, more and yet reliable results with much smaller samples and at much less investment costs, thus speeding up the innovation process in RampD of polymer materials, pharmaceutical, biomedical and nutritional applications.Microcompounding is typically performed with

The advantage of the use of a microcompounder for RampD are significant it gives faster, more and yet reliable results with much smaller samples and at much less investment costs, thus speeding up the innovation process in RampD of polymer materials, pharmaceutical, biomedical and nutritional applications.Microcompounding is typically performed with a table top, twin screw microcompounder or extruder with a working volume of 5 or 15 ml. With such small volumes it is almost impossible to have sufficient mixing in a continuous extruder. Therefore, state of the art microcompounders have a batch mode recirculation and a conical shape. The LD of a continuous twin screw extruder is mimicked in a batch microcompounder by the recirculation mixing time, which is controlled by a manual valve. With this valve the recirculation can be interrupted to unload the formulation in either a strand, or an injection moulder, a film device or a fiber line. Typical recirculation times are 13 min, dependent on the ease of dispersive and distributive mixing of the formulation.Microcompounding is typically performed with a table top, twin screw microcompounder or extruder with a working volume of 5 or 15 ml.
