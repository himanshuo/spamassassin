I spend quite a bit of time in Vegas for work and we ventured away from the overpriced junk on the strip to find this gem!  We chose to try it based on yelp reviews.  We walked from Fremont street area and for a little bit thought it was a joke as the area was rather shady.  And then there it was!  

An obviously hipster hole in the wall with amazing food and unbeatable value! I was joined by a couple of food snobs and they couldn't believe how good it was.   I got the pork Ossobucco.  Very little fat and I could pull it apart with a fork.  Incredible flavor.  Others got the NY strip which was very tender and cooked perfectly.  The sides are shareable sized so we got the broccoli crunch, rissoto, and Mac &  cheese ....all incredible.
