I've been twice and have personally witnessed the glory that is Langer's. Possibly the best Corned Beef sandwich I've ever had. Whaaa? No pastrami? Patience, my friend. I have to ease into this the best way I know how. 

I tried a couple dishes that I have had at any other top tier deli. Think Nate n Al's, think Brent's. (Langer's, Nate n Al's and Brent's are the top three, IMO. Cantors and Greenblatt's have their merits and their fans, but are runner-ups.)
