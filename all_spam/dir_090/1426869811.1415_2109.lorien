Muslim Mulliqi 1934  13 January 1998 was an impressionist and expressionist painter of Kosovo. Born into a family of artists in town, Mulliqi attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Belgrade under Zoran Petrovi, where he also continued with the postgraduate studies. Mulliqi exposed in galleries of Kosovo, exYugoslavia, Italy and Albania. Mulliqi was the initiator of the foundation and vicepresident of the Academy of Sciences of Kosovo. He taught Painting in the Faculty of Arts at the University of Prishtina. Kosovo Art Gallery exhibition holds his name. While his creations are everlasting, academic Mulliqi was and will remain one of the most prominent figures of the Albanian art. He died in 1998 in Prishtina.His work is characterized by bold use of colors, firm rhythm, endless space, influenced by his native Dukagjin region.His work is characterized by bold use of colors, firm rhythm, endless space, influenced by his native Dukagjin region.His work is characterized by bold use of colors, firm rhythm, endless space, inf

He was educated at Andes Academy, and graduated A.B. from Rutgers College as valedictorian of the class of 1884. Then he studied law in the office of Cassius M.

The signal to be amplified is a train of constant amplitude pulses, so the active devices switch rapidly back and forth between a fully conductive and nonconductive state. The analog signal to be amplified is converted to a series of pulses by pulse width modulation, pulse density modulation or other method before being applied to the amplifier. After amplification, the output pulse train can be converted back to an analog signal by passing through a passive low pass filter consisting of inductors and capacitors. The major advantage of a classD amplifier is that it can be more efficient than analog amplifiers, with less power dissipated as heat in the active devices.Output stages such as those used in pulse generators are examples of classD amplifiers. However, the term mostly applies to power amplifiers intended to reproduce signals with a bandwidth well below the switching frequency.Output stages such as those used in pulse generators are examples of classD amplifiers.
