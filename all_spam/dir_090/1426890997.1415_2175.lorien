Back A Yard was sooo good!  I shared a specialty entr??e with my sister and the portions were large enough to feed us both.  We shared the oxtail and jerk pork entr??e which came with sides of coconut rice and fried plantains.  My sister also ordered a ginger beer and I had mango passion fruit juice, both of which are freshly made there!  This little joint was very busy which goes to show that their food is that good and worth the wait.  Back A Yard is the type of place where you place your order at the counter, take a number for the table, and they bring your food to your table.  Even though they were busy, our food came out in a timely manner and we had a decent sized group.
