I'd been trying to get a tour here for a couple of years, and finally got one on a Friday morning. Sure we had to schedule our yearly trip one extra day (early) to make it, but it was well worth it.


We did happen to go on a day where it wasn't up and running, which was slightly disappointing but not that big of a deal. It was a cleaning and maintenance day, so all staff was busy with that.
