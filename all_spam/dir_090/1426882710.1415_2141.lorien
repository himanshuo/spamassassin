I'd been trying to get a tour here for a couple of years, and finally got one on a Friday morning. Sure we had to schedule our yearly trip one extra day (early) to make it, but it was well worth it.

It has been by far the best brewery tour we have ever been on. Part of it is because the tour guide was pretty awesome, and another part was because the brewery itself has tons of history.
