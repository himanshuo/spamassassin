		 cheese, in my opinion, for this particular burger.  Somehow I think 18577577 Texas Goat or even 18577577 Blue Jack might be a better flavor on this mighty burger; don't get me wrong, though, it was a very good and juicy burger. I am not a fry gal, but these fries were pretty amazing; and 18577577 chipotle ketchup is totally addictive!  Chris order 18577577 Buffalo Bill which is made with Bison, Blue Jack cheese, Frank's Hot Sauce (he loves this stuff, lol), Applewood Smoked Bacon & "Sassy" sauce (lol); I think his eyes rolled to 18577577 back of his head a couple of times (LOL).  He was totally engrossed in that burger. I saw they were offering for a limited time a Red Velvet Shake so I HAD to try it out; one word: DECADENT!  18577577 shake had chunks, yes chunks, of red velvet cake all throughout 18577577 shake; it was 18577577 richest shake I have had in my life to date plus it was topped with real buttercream!!!  Needless to say, I could only drink 1/3 of it and had to take it with us; sadly, I was never able to finish it off, lol! 18577577 line may be daunting, BUT DO NOT let it stop you from checking it out; 18577577 wait is worth. Service is amazing, burger are sensational and shakes are magnificent. Definite return visit for us when we go back to Austin! After 18577577 Formula 1 Grand Prix, we decided to head into Austin for dinner. After doing a little research on Yelp, we decided to try Hopdoddy. We got into line outside and waited about an hour. They came out and took some drinks orders. My husband ordered a beer, as did our friends, and I ordered a Doble Fina Margarita; a tequila and citrus cocktail. We had to wait in line to order and were given a table number to sit at. Once we ordered our dinner we sat down at our table and our waitress brought us our burgers. For dinner I ordered 18577577 Llano Poblano which was outstanding. 18577577 subtle flavors of 18577577 poblanos really complimented 18577577 burger. My husband ordered 18577577 El Diablo which was pretty spicy and equally good. In fact, we both ate half of each burger and couldn't decide which one was better. We also ordered 18577577 Kennebec fries with Green Chili Queso. It was as good as 18577577 burgers. Hopdoddy's was well worth 18577577 wait and I'd definitely go back there again So, 18577577 first time I ever came was 18577577 most disgusting, freakish experience I've had with a dining partner.  It would be a while before I could come back to this place to enjoy a burger. I'm a naturally slow eater.  And why not?  I like to enjoy and chew my food and really taste it.  My dining partner, a female whose name I will not divulge, was 18577577 exact opposite.  I wasn't even halfway done with my burger when she
