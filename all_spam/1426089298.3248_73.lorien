Border Gateway Protocol BGP is a standardized exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability information between autonomous systems AS on the Internet. The protocol is often classified as a path vector protocol but is sometimes also classed as a distancevector routing protocol. The Border Gateway Protocol makes routing decisions based on paths, network policies, or rulesets configured by a network administrator and is involved in making core routing decisions.BGP may be used for routing within an AS. In this application it is referred to as Interior Border Gateway Protocol, Internal BGP, or iBGP. In contrast, the Intern

In contrast, the Internet application of the protocol may be referred to as Exterior Border Gateway Protocol, External BGP, or EBGP.HLAB46 B46 is an HLAB serotype. The serotype identifies the gene products of HLAB4601 allele. B4601 resulted from a rare, interlocus, gene conversion between B62, probably B1501, and a HLAC allele. B4601 is the most common HLAB allele that does not have an origin within Africa, and estimated 400 million people in Eastern Asia carry a B46 allele. When found B4601 segregates with only 2 HLACw alleles, A limited number of HLAA and HLADRB1 alleles suggesting that the allele recently expanded from a limited sized group within SE Asia. Extremely low frequencies outside of Eastern Asia are indicators of a recent expansion of B46 from a recently small population. The frequency distribution suggests the ancestral B46 population was in SE China, or, potentially Burma Myanmar or Laos, untested. B46 in Asia correlates with wetrice farming. The exceptions are notable, it has been found in the Nivkhi on northeastern Sakalin Island, the Ainu, and the Nivkhirelated genetically Tlinglet population of Alaska at trace levels.
