Anny's was such a pleasant find! I walked from home which was another plus. Its a tiny establishment which contributes to its charm. i believe it is a mother and son operation and they do a wonderful job. I ordered Anny's Favorite smoothie with almond milk and blueberries. it was a delicious combination that could have been a meal. Lots of peanut butter flavor so it was very rich and could have used more ice on such a hot day..but none the less a great smoothie. I also tried Anny's Incredible sandwich. Turkey AVO Bacon Tomato Sprouts Cream Cheese on any bread you like. I got sourdough..it was a good sandwich, very salty turkey but other than that yummy! I will be back to try some other menu items!f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Can I just get a hoot-hoot for the DELICIOUS Matcha Tiramisu Cake here!!! It's the one of the best I have had, even compared to the ones I have had in Asia! Definitely a must try when you come here in the mood for some desert! It is the perfect combo of the light, refreshing, and tiny tiny bitter taste of green tea, mixed with creamy, rich mascarpone! It's not too sweet and just right!!! 

This cafe has a really cute vibe and a variety of menu items to satisfy your every hunger or thirst! Although it is a little pricey, this is LA and all the cafes around here are more or so this price! My friends and I came for some late afternoon tea and dessert! We got the Thai tea latte, Matcha latte, and the Cafe mocha latte. The lattes here were great and came with cute latte art designs! I preferred the Matcha latte over the others as I thought they were a little bland. 

I also got the Salmon Bagel plate for a snack. I think the bagel is pretty big and it comes with lots of salmon so it was a pretty good deal. I did enjoy the capers that came with it and the herb cream cheese as well. 

Overall, this is a wonderful little cafe! I highly recommend it. However, beware when coming during rush hours because there is limited seating and you might have to wait in line and jump on the first open table you see!f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
