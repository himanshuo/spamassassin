I went to Nazca one Sunday for brunch with my bf. I was expecting really good things, as they have been getting consistently good reviews, and their menu looked super appetizing. Their decor when we walked in was really neat. I loved the waterfall and the patio seating area that looked like a giant sun room. 

Our waiter came up to take our order, and we decided to split a sangria. He put the sangria in two smaller glasses, which was nice of him, but we were not impressed that the sangrias were 80% ice, and 20% drink. We asked him about dessert, because I had a check in offer, and were immediately disappointed to discover that nothing on the dessert menu was dairy-free, which meant my bf could not eat any. Big bummer.
