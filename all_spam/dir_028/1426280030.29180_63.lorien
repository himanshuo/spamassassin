Consumer bruce@untroubled.org,

A researcher in Washington D.C. has recently revealed 7 Toxic Prescriptions the United states Administration can't wait for you to swallow.

If only I was able to state this was only a conspiracy speculation, however, this whistle-blower has solid documentation this Administration  is cramming harmful medicines down your throat ... and getting rich, while you're rushed to the ER.

Who knows how long The List will be accessible before the Administration squelches it... so don't wait a minute longer. 

Go here right now for the entire full list and story "they" don't want you to see,
