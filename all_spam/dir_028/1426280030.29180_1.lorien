While I was in St. Louis exploring I discovered Sauce on the Side via its Yelp score and made it a target for a visit. We don't have anything quite like Sauce on the Side in Cincinnati or any of the other cities I've lived (Baltimore, DC, Knoxville, Lansing...) nor have I seen anything like it anywhere else on my visits (NYC, Boston, LA, Chicago...).

When I arrived they seemed to be just getting busy after the Cardinals vs Dodgers game let out. I was glad to rather literally get in just before a rush of people.

I'd been walking for a while and was fairly hungry, but the size of the calzones I was seeing come out were  more than enough to satiate my appetite.
