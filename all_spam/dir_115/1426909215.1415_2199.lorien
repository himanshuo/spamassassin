I've tried Zak's bread at Pinecrest Farmers Market, and it's available also at Atelier Monnier and Whole Foods, but I've been wanting to make a pilgrim to their restaurant for the longest time.  It wasn't easy given their hours and I don't work or live nearby.  So glad stars finally aligned and here I am!  

Walking in I really love the quaint, country home atmosphere.  Blackboard menu, loaves of bread and pies are on display on the counter, real flowers in jars, water and iced tea in what looks like gigantic mason jars.  The decor is reclaimed, whitewashed wood and white tiles. Behind the counter you can see the bakery in action, as the staff kneads, rolls and shapes the dough. Charming to the nth degree!
