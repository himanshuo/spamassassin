Being semi new to houston I really rely on recommendations of others. On a random Wednesday I decided it was time to try out a bar I had been recommended. Got there about 7 and parking was full I almost decided to leave and the 3 spots opened. There is a lot on the side of the building. This is also where the entrance is. 

Cool just oozes out of this place. The architecture in the pulleys that drive the fans to the solid wood bar stools (still reasonably comfortable). 

The clientele when I first arrived was obviously people after work, dressed nice, as the evening carried on more jeans arrived but either it only attracts cool people or when you walk in the door you magically feel cooler.  This is not the bar you go to if you roll out of bed and just need a drink.
