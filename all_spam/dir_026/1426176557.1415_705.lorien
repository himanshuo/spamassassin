It replaced the BMW E28 in 1988 and was replaced by the E39 in 1996. Development ran from July 1981 to late 1987, with design specifications being chosen in 1982 and finalized for production in mid1985.In the NorthAmerican market the E34 succeeded the BMW E28 in May 1988  with two models. The 525i used the BMW M20 engine while the 535i used the larger M30. The cars were a blend of BMW tradition and modern technology. BMW's traditional FR layout and straight6 were used, providing the smooth engine and optimal weight distribution BMW customers had come to expect. New 5series also had a much stiffer body and was more streamlined than its predecessor, and had design cues introduced in 1986 on the 7series by designer Ercole Spada. J Mays was equally responsible for the final production E34 design in 1984, later completed in summer of 1985, following the 1982 and 1983 proposals by Spada.In the NorthAmerican market the E34 succeeded the BMW E28 in May 1988  with two models.
