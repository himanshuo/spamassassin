The phenomenon is linked to the socalled NIMBY Not In My Back Yard phenomenon in which residents oppose a development as being inappropriate for their local area.While the NIMBY phenomenon is typically related to development issues, CAVE people, as the name implies, oppose virtually everything. This may manifest itself in opposition to changes in public policy questions as varied as tax levies, sewer rates, public transportation routes, parking regulations and municipal mergers or annexations. "CAVE People" often express their views by attending community meetings, writing letters to the local newspaper, or calling in to talk radio shows.While the NIMBY phenomenon is typically related to development issues, CAVE people, as the name implies, oppose virtually everything.
