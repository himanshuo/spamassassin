The continents are not named. The Valdemar Saga primarily focuses on the story of the nation of Valdemar, and according to Mercedes Lackeys official bibliography, there are thirty novels and seven anthologies.The Petlyakov Pe8 was a Soviet heavy bomber designed before World War II, and the only fourengine bomber the USSR built during the war. Produced in limited numbers, it was used to bomb Berlin in August 1941. It was also used for socalled "morale raids" designed to raise the spirit of the Soviet people by exposing Axis vulnerabilities. Its primary mission, however, was to attack German airfields, rail yards and other reararea facilities at night, although one was used to fly the People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov from Moscow to the United States in 1942.Originally designated the TB7, the aircraft was renamed the Pe8 after its primary designer, Vladimir Petlyakov, who died in a plane crash in 1942. Supply problems complicated the aircraft's production and the Pe8s also had engine problems. As Soviet morale boosters, they were also highvalue targets for the Luftwaffe's fighter pilots. The loss rate of these aircraft, whether from mechanical failure, friendly fire, or combat, doubled between 1942 and 1944.Originally designated the TB7, the aircraft was renamed the Pe8 after its primary designer, Vladimir Petlyakov, who died in a plane crash in 1942.
