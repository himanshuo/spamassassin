This place definitely lives up to the hype. I stopped in for lunch because I was in the area and I was pretty much set on the Asian Hangover, because that's what yelp was telling me was the choice. However, I consulted with the server and he confirmed that it was his favorite thing on the menu as well.  SOLD.

It came out pretty quickly, as it was about 11:30 on a Monday so it wasn't very busy. I asked for sriracha, but no, sadly they did not have sriracha. Boo hiss. However, he brought me out cholula and two other sauces that were unique and delicious.
