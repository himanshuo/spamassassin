He played college football for the University of Texas, and earned AllAmerican honors. The Atlanta Falcons chose him in the second round of the 2007 NFL Draft, and he played for them from 2007 to 2014.Stphan Barron was the first to develop the concept of Technoromanticism between 1991 and 1996 for his doctoral thesis at the University Paris VIII. The main theme of his research is what he calls TechnoromantismeTechnoromanticism, a neologism which he created and which has been adopted by other Englishspeaking researchers. Technoromantism is the theory of links between art and new technologies, within the context of the threats posed to Nature by technoscience and economic development. Technoromanticism also seeks to analyse the return of the human body within technological arts, formulating the hypothesis that a technological society needs a corporeal rebalancing of perceptions. Delayed for editorial reasons, his book Technoromantisme was published by l'Harmattan in 2003. Technoromanticism is a term used to indicate those aspects of contemporary culture that ascribe to advanced technologies the capacity to promote the power of the imagination, to restore the role of genius and to bring about a unity in other words that revive and perpetuate the legacy of the eighteenth and nineteenthcentury artistic and philosophical movement known as Romanticism, but by technological means. The term was used in 1999 in a book that bore the title Technoromanticism outlining evidence of romanticism in many commentaries on digital technology at the time.As such, technoromanticism attributes to technology the capacity to redeem humankind from its problems and bring about technoutopias. According to this thesis, technoromanticism is idealistic, it also looks backwards, seeing in advanced technologies the opportunity to return to craft values, analogous to William Morris romance with Medieval guilds. It appeals to narratives of wholeness, against rationalism which is putatively reductive. Moves to invoke digital networks as a means of returning human society and the world to an organic whole could be regarded as technoromantic, as well as digital technologys supposed religiously redemptive aspects. f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
