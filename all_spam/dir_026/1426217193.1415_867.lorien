A few of my friends and I decided to spend a few nights in LA to meet up with someone, so we wanted to try different restaurants, cafes, and dessert bars, including this one. 

Harajuku Crepe is located in Beverly Hills near one of the shopping areas. The little shop may be a little hard to spot at first, but when you do... you'll have to find parking somewhere else around the area. Like everywhere else in LA, you'll have to look for street parking (or garage parking) a few blocks away, but personally I didn't mind that bit of exercise. Just make sure to pay for metered parking and read signs regarding hours.
