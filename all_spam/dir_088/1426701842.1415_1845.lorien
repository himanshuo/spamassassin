Funny story about how I stumbled across these guys. I was reading about a new ice cream parlor in Las Vegas when I read that they get their ice cream from Treat. I couldn't visit the new shop because I wasn't in Vegas. I was in the San Jose area with family.

After clearing out sufficient freezer space to hold one container of ice cream, I made my way to Treat. Well, I tried to get there anyway - by following the map which directs you across the street to Wienerschnitzel. After I looked around fruitlessly, I gave up and asked a Wienerschnitzel employee for directions. They pointed me toward the parking lot and told me to keep walking toward the back.
