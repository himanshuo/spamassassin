Potential Buyer bruce@untroubled.org,

A specialist in Washington D.C. has blown the lid off 7 Unhealthy Medicines the American Govt can't wait for you to swallow.

I wish I was able to say this was merely a conspiracy possibility, sadly, this whistle-blower has real confirmation this Administration  is shoving unhealthy medications down your throat ... and laughing all the way to the bank, while you're sick as a dog.

Who knows how long The List will be obtainable before "Big Brother" prohibits it... so don't wait a moment more. 

Go here right now for the whole full list and story "they" don't want you to know,
