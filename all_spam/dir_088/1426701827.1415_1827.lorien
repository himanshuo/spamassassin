I've come to this place every week ever since my mom became a huge fan two months ago. Every time I???m in line some stranger would come over all confused about the line and ask "what is it about this bakery?" I would always say the same thing: "they make really good chocolate chip cookies." But after trying essentially everything sold here, I'm gonna say what I've been thinking the entire time: overrated.
