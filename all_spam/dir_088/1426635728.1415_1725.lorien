Wondering what a combination of Mauritian, African, Indian, Pacific Islander, and Asian cuisines might be like?  No?  GO ANYWAY!!  The food is alchemical genius.  I don't think I could be more addicted to their food if they put crack in it...  Luckily just the simple magic of noodles, chicken (my usual meat of choice, and there's PLENTY of it), and some sauce and veggies that must be enchanted.  It's a little bit of a wait when they're busy, but don't ever let that throw you because it's worth it every. single. time.  If they ask you if you want chutney, say YES!  Unless you're afraid of spicy hot food, then get it on the side, but at least try it.
