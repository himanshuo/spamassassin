In 1926 he met old foe Genaro for a third time and defeated him by a decision.I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, the 1969 autobiography about the early years of AfricanAmerican writer and poet Maya Angelou, features many characters, including Angelou as a child, which she has called "the Maya character". The first in a sixvolume series, Caged Bird is a comingofage story that illustrates how strength of character and a love of literature can help overcome racism and trauma. The book begins when threeyearold Maya and her older brother are sent to Stamps, Arkansas, to live with their grandmother and ends when Maya becomes a mother at the age of 16. In the course of Caged Bird, Maya transforms from a victim of racism into a selfpossessed, dignified young woman capable of responding to prejudice.Caged Bird has been categorized as an autobiography, but Angelou utilizes fictionwriting techniques such as dialogue, thematic development, and characterization. She uses the firstperson narrative voice customary with autobiographies, but also includes fictionlike elements, told from the perspective of a child that is "artfully recreated by an adult narrator". She uses two distinct voices, the adult writer and the child who is the focus of the book, whom Angelou calls "the Maya character". Angelou reports that maintaining the distinction between herself and "the Maya character" is "damned difficult", but "very necessary". Scholar Liliane Arensberg suggests that Angelou "retaliates for the tonguetied child's helpless pain" by using her adult's irony and wit. Angelou recognizes that there are fictional aspects to her books  she tends to "diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth". In a 1998 interview with journalist George Plimpton, Angelou discussed "the sometimes slippery notion of truth in nonfiction" and memoirs, stating, "Sometimes I make a diameter from a composite of three or four people, because the essence in only one person is not sufficiently strong to be written about." f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
