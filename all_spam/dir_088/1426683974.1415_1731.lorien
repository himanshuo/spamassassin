This list does not include pre1980s regional territories or presentday promotions affiliated with the National Wrestling Alliance.Robert Lin January 24, 1942160 November 17, 2012 was a professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley. His research focused on experimental space physics and high energy astrophysics. He made major contributions to topics involving solar flares, plasma phenomena in the Earth's magnetosphere, lunar and planetary geology, heliospheric physics, and highenergy astrophysics. In 2006, Lin was elected to the National Academy of Sciences for his contributions to the "behavior of electrons and ions accelerated by the sun, and detected the accompanying xray and gammaray emissions." He was the Principal Investigator for RHESSI.The 201314 Calgary Flames season was the 34th season in Calgary and 42nd for the Flames franchise in the National Hockey League NHL. It was the first season of a rebuilding phase, and the first full year following the departure of longtime captain Jarome Iginla and goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff. Mark Giordano replaced Iginla as team captain. The Flames also began the year in a new division as they returned to the Pacific Division following a leaguewide realignment. Change continued into the playing season as new team president Brian Burke fired general manager Jay Feaster on December 12, 2013, and assumed the role himself on an interim basis.Calgary's home arena, the Scotiabank Saddledome, suffered significant damage over the summer during widespread flooding that inundated the land around the arena. The facility was repaired in time for the playing season, a year in which the Flames were widely predicted to finish in last place in the Pacific Division. Calgary finished the year with a 35407 record to finish sixth in the seventeam division and failed to qualify for the playoffs for the fifth consecutive season. The team's top selection at the 2013 NHL Entry Draft, Sean Monahan, made the squad as an 18yearold and finished second in team goal scoring with 22 goals. Michael Cammalleri led with 26 goals, while Jiri Hudler was the team leader in assists 37 and points 54. Karri Ramo was one of four goaltenders to appear for Calgary, and led the team with 17 wins.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
