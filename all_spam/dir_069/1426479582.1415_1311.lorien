The Siege of Perpignan was a siege during the Catalan Revolt.The troops of Louis XIII of France besieged Perpignan since November 4, 1641. The King himself was present during spring 1642, but left before the conquest of the city. Two Spanish attempts to relieve the city failed on land in the Battle of Montmel on March 28 and at sea in the Battle of Barcelona in July. The governor, the Marquis de Flores Dvila, was forced to surrender the city on September 9, 1642, because of the large number of casualties by hunger and the fall of Cotlliure. The city was occupied by French troops supported by the Catalan rebels. There were only 500 Spanish survivors.[citation needed]T
