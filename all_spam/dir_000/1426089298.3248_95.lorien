We finally came here to see what the hype was all about.  The interior is really tiny but the patio is pretty big!  We opted to sit outside as it was a beautiful day.  I ordered the Locals Only which consisted of mustard, bacon, chopped jalapeno, and slice of American.  My burger was so freaking good.  The patty was really huge and so flavorful.  The patty was cooked perfectly as it was very moist and not dry at all.  I devoured my burger and enjoyed every single bite of it.  The other folks at the table really enjoyed their burger.  OSK had to be one of the best burgers I've tried.  Even the fries were really good.  We ended our meal with a fried pie and it was so fantastic.  All the staff here were so friendly.  I can't wait to come back here for another burger.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Located at the corner of Sylvan and Irving, this beige brown modest building holds more charm and nostalgia, besides truly amazing food. Look for the 3 foot cheese burger in the front parking lot. Of course Off Site offers more than the traditional burgers, but that truly is their speciality. 

Today I sampled their OWP Corned Beef, which is served with cherry pepper kraut, 57 Thousand slaw, on a toasted buttery hogie roll. The corned beef was so tender, with the right amount of spices lingering. My only less than thought, for an $8 sandwich, it needed a smidge more meat. But the flavors and textures were spot on. The slightly crispy hogie outside melts in a soft tender inside, which is pure heaven to every foodie in town, plus some.

Their russet fries are hand cut shoe string potatoes with skins on. Lightly dusted with garlic salt. And if it couldn't get any better it does.  By the lunch counter,  there are roughly 6 or more sauces to kick up any side or entree on a whim. 

My overall rating, great on all levels, from customer service, ambience, food quality, to variety of vintage sodas.  Liz was very friendly in helping me decide my lunch selection, it really hit my foodie craving. She mentioned OSK is relocating to Trinity Groves in the coming weeks to offer guests more indoor seating options.

To me the only little teeny tiny zinger, is the price to value ratio. $3 for a vintage 12oz of Coca Cola seemed a bit much. But then again, I don't drink soda often, so no biggie really. 

And it is sad to see no real hand crafted fresh dessert options. Today I actually wasn't feeling the self serve ice cream. The petite pies displaced by the front counter look like something I can buy at my local grocery store. Perhaps with their new move, fresh unique hand made artisan dessert delights could be offered,  ala mode one can hope.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
