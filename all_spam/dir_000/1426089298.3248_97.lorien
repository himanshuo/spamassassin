TritiumTritium trtim or trim symbol T or 3H, also known as hydrogen3 is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. The nucleus of tritium sometimes called a triton contains one proton and two neutrons, whereas the nucleus of protium by far the most abundant hydrogen isotope contains one proton and no neutrons. Naturally occurring tritium is extremely rare on Earth, where trace amounts are formed by the interaction of the atmosphere with cosmic rays. The name of this isotope is formed from the Greek word "tritos" meaning "third".Cavalcade is a light rail station on the Red Line of METRORail in Houston, Texas, United States. it opened on December 21, 2013 as part of the Red Line extension.The Gang's All Here is a 1939 British, blackandwhite, comedymystery, directed by Thornton Freeland and starring Jack Buchanan.

It lies approximately 15 kilometres 9160mi south of Tomaszw Lubelski and 120160km 75160mi southeast of the regional capital Lublin.Aspidosaurus is an extinct genus of dissorophoid temnospondyl within the family Dissorophidae. Like other dissorophids, Aspidosaurus species had a single row of plates formed by expansions of the neural spines.In 1911, Paul Miller discovered the remains of various dissorophid bones in New Mexico that were attributed to a new species, Aspidosaurus novomexicanus. The skull closely resembled that of a specimen of Cacops aspidephorus found in Texas but the arrangement of ridges in the otic region was different. The teeth found were slender and conical and all of an approximately equal size. The vertebral column, pelvis and limb bones were also similar but the new specimen was distinguished from Cacops by the armour, the single row of vertical plates that were originally attached to the neural spines of the vertebrae. A. novomexicanus was later attributed to the genus Broiliellus. More recently, "A." novomexicanus has been removed from Broiliellus and classified as a closer relative of Cacops. The original specimen is now housed in the University of California Museum of Paleontology and is referred to as the "Rio Arriba taxon" because of its uncertain phylogenetic placement.In 1911, Paul Miller discovered the remains of various dissorophid bones in New Mexico that were attributed to a new species, Aspidosaurus novomexicanus.
