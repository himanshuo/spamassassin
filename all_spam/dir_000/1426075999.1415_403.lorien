THIS JUST IN:7 Deadly Drugs the U.S. Government can't wait for you to swallow.

================================================================

U.S. Consumer bruce@untroubled.org,

THIS JUST IN: An insider near Washington D.C. has just blown the lid off the 7 Deadly Drugs the U.S. Government can't wait for you to swallow.

I wish I could say this was just a conspiracy theory, but this whistleblower has concrete evidence "the powers that be" are shoving pure poison down your throat... and laughing all the way to the bank, while you're carted off to the graveyard.

Who knows how long this list will be up before "Big Brother" catches on... so don't wait a moment longer. 

Go here right now for the full list and story "they" don't want you to know:

To knowing the truth,

Paul Amos
Associate Director, HSI


P.S. You won't believe what innocent little pill rounds out the list at #1. If you're taking it regularly, you're 530% more likely to die TONIGHT. Make sure it's not in your medicine cabinet. Click here for the full list.

I've come to this place every week ever since my mom became a huge fan two months ago. Every time im in line some stranger would come over all confused about the line and ask "what is it about this bakery?" I would always say the same thing: "they make really good chocolate chip cookies." But after trying essentially everything sold here, I'm gonna say what I've been thinking the entire time: overrated.
