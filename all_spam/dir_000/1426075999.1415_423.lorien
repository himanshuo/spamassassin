He is a former mayor of McAlester, Oklahoma.The PolishLithuanian War was an armed conflict between newly independent Lithuania and Poland in the aftermath of World War I. The conflict primarily concerned territorial control of the Vilnius Region, including Vilnius Polish Wilno, and the Suwaki Region, including the towns of Suwaki, Augustw, and Sejny. The conflict was largely shaped by the progress in the PolishSoviet War and international efforts to mediate at the Conference of Ambassadors and later the League of Nations. There are major differences in Polish and Lithuanian historiography regarding treatment of the war. According to Lithuanian historians, the war was part of the Lithuanian Wars of Independence and spanned from spring 1919 to November 1920. According to Poland, the war included only fighting over the Suwaki Region in SeptemberOctober 1920 and was part of the PolishSoviet War.In April 1919, Poland captured Vilnius and came in contact with the Lithuanian Army fighting in the LithuanianSoviet War. Faced with a common enemy, the PolishLithuanian relations were not immediately hostile. Poland hoped to persuade Lithuania to join some kind of PolishLithuanian union see the Midzymorze federation, which Lithuania saw as loss of independence to Polish federalism. As bilateral relations worsened, the Entente drew two demarcation lines in hopes to stall further open hostilities. The lines did not please anyone and were ignored. When a Polish coup against the Lithuanian government failed in August 1919, the front stabilized until summer 1920. f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
