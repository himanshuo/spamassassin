The device is a variation of a Wheatstone bridge, which dates to 1833 and measures electrical resistance and skin conductance. It is formally known as the Hubbard Electrometer although it is not an electrometer as usually defined after the group's founder, L. Ron Hubbard. Most of the Scientology concepts associated with the "Emeter" and its use are regarded by the scientific and medical communities as pseudoscience, and the Emeter has never been subject to clinical trials.The Church of Scientology restricts the use of the Emeter to trained Scientologists, treating it as "a religious artifact used to measure the state of electrical characteristics of the 'static field' surrounding the body".[citation needed] The meter, when used by a trained Scientologist, is claimed to reflect or indicate whether or not a person has been relieved from spiritual impediment of past experiences. Officials within Scientology assert that the Emeter is intended for use only in churchsanctioned auditing sessions and is in itself not a curative or medical device. The Emeters used by the Church of Scientology are manufactured by Scientologists at their Gold Base facility. f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
