		 us with new utensils for each upcoming course. Gary Danko provided me with a very initimate and beautiful restaurant, absolutely delicious food, and impeccable service.  Thank you for a wonderful dining experience! "Have a good night and hope to see you soon" I DO hope to come back here soon! Gary Danko is worth 24577820 hype and all 24577820 top restaurant honors. I am still salivating and reminiscing about my dinner. By sheer luck and 24577820 stars & moon in alignment I was able to get a reservation for 10:00pm at night on a Sunday. Who eats at ten on a Sunday? Yeah right!! So good. My friend tried alittle trick to get a reservation.  There is no wait-list. 24577820 maitre d'  informed us that they do seat people at 24577820 bar first come first service.  I found 24577820 waitstaff very attentive and genuine. Thankfully I was on a business dinner so money was no object.  I had a few glasses of 24577820 most divine Philipponnat, Royale R??serve ros?? champagne. I could get use to a life of luxury. I had 24577820 appetizer of risotto with lobster,  and dungeness crab. This was my first time tasting both lobster & risotto, now I don't think any other place will compare. I know I am going to try to make a trip back soon just for this dish. For an entree I had 24577820 herb crusted tuna with crispy potatoes. This was delightful. 24577820 herbs and seasoning used were so flavorful. I notice on both dishes I did not have to think about additional salting or seasoning. Also 24577820 portions of food were so ample. I was stuffed. It was around 11:30 pm and after a few lavender infused cocktails to boot, I was having a hard time keeping my eyes open. When 24577820 dessert menu was presented I could not order a bite more. My companion did... some macaroons and ice cream dish I could only muster taking a bite. Then 24577820 waiter brought out a canopy of bite-size desserts. We could eat no more. They were wrapped up into a neat black box with a Gary Danko sticker. Then as you are leaving now 11:45pm they presented me with a pumpkin breakfast muffin for 24577820 next day. That is what I call service. They even call a taxicab for their dining guests.  This restaurant deserves 6 stars. 1) Crispy Farm Egg with White Polenta, Royal Trumpet Mushrooms, Fris??e and Pancetta: Very tasty and interesting dish with all 24577820 different flavors and textures. Each bite is definitely different and I especially enjoyed 24577820 trumpet mushrooms and frisee. Yum! 24577820 only thing about this dish though was that although a good portion of 24577820 egg was runny, it was a tad overcooked. 2) Roast Maine Lobster with Potato Pur??e, Chanterelle Mushrooms, Corn and Tarragon: Such a pretty presentation! 24577820 lobster was well cooked and not overdone. 24577820 potato puree was blended just right and not gritty or lumpy at all and you could definitely taste 24577820 tarragon. 3) Roasted Pork Belly and Tenderloin with Brussels Sprouts, Apples, Parsnip Puree and Maple Cider
