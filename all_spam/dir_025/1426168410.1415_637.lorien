They are haploid, reproduce asexually, they can be characterised by true multicellular organisation with plasmodesmata, creating planar sprawling discs on solid surfaces in freshwater streams worldwide, usually as epiphytes on aquatic plants or growing on the surface of stones. They are seen as one of two most probable sister groups to land plant species. The second candidates being the Characeae, the issue  as of 2009  is still not solved. As they show some of the earliest and simplest features of multicellular plant growth, that makes them ideal model organisms in the field of synthetic biology.[citation needed] They are easy to culture and techniques that have been used to study Arabidopsis thaliana are now being applied to the Coleochaete.Ningxiang County simplified Chinese  traditional Chinese  pinyin Nngxing Xin literally "peaceful home" is under the administration of Changsha, the capital of Hunan province, ChinaAbruptum is a black metal and dark ambient solo sideproject band from Sweden.
