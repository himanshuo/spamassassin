The English Language Unity Act was first introduced in 2005. It hoped to establish English as the official language of the federal government of the United States. If passed it would require that all official functions and proceedings of federal and state government be conducted in English. It would also require that applicants for naturalization be tested on their ability to read and generally understand the English language. They would be tested on the laws of the United States as well as other important documents that relate to the law, including the Declaration of Independence and Constitution. It would also require that all naturalization ceremonies be conducted in English. If a person became injured because of violations of this Act, they would be able to file suit in court. Before this act could be considered by the House of Representatives it had to be approved

Before this act could be considered by the House of Representatives it had to be approved by the House Judiciary, and Education and the Workforce Committees.The English Language Unity Act is based on a similar bill, "The Bill Emerson English Language Empowerment Act", which passed in the House of Representatives in 1996. However, it never became law. It tried to amend Federal law to declare English to be the official language of the U.S. Government. If it became a law, it would have required state representatives to conduct official business in English. It would have required that all officials conduct naturalization ceremonies entirely in English as well. Conservative Republican lawmaker Representative Steve King introduced this act to the House of Representatives on March 1, 2005 it was known as the English Language Unity Act of 2005. Before the 109th session ended of congress, the bill accumulated 164 sponsors. The last action on this bill was the introductory remarks on the proposed bill on May 19, 2006. The bill did not come up for debate during this session of Congress, so it is said to have died.The 2013 PDC European Tour Event 4 also known as the 2013 Austrian Darts Open was the fourth of eight European Tour events on the 2013 PDC Pro Tour. The tournament took place at the Arena Nova in Wiener Neustadt, Austria, from 31 May to 2 June. It featured a field of 64 players and 100,000 in prize money, with 20,000 going to the winner.Michael van Gerwen won his second European Tour title by beating Mervyn King 63 in the final.Michael van Gerwen won his second European Tour title by beating Mervyn King 63 in the final.Michael van Gerwen won his second European Tour title by beating Mervyn King 63 in the final.Michael van Gerwen won his second European Tour title by beating Mervyn King 63 in the final. f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
