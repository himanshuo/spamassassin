Although we had reservations at 8:15 pm, we still had to wait about 15 minutes for our table.  Not a big deal at all, but they don't really have a good area to wait in, so everyone was crowded around the host stand. It's amazing how crowded Da Pasquale was on a Monday night when all the restaurants surrounding it were totally empty.  Judging from the crowd, I'd imagine that they have a lot of local and regular clientele.
