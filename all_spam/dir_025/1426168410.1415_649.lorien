Interestingly, when a friend told us about Da Pasquale on Sunday, it had 4.5 stars, and by the time we got there on Monday, it had 4 stars, which I would say is definitely a more accurate rating.  I would say it's right around 3.5 stars, maybe 4 if comparing to other restaurants in the immediate area (places in Beverly Hills are usually more about the scene and location than the food, and Da Pasquale is in the heart of it), so I will round up.

Although we had reservations at 8:15 pm, we still had to wait about 15 minutes for our table.  Not a big deal at all, but they don't really have a good area to wait in, so everyone was crowded around the host stand. It's amazing how crowded Da Pasquale was on a Monday night when all the restaurants surrounding it were totally empty.  Judging from the crowd, I'd imagine that they have a lot of local and regular clientele.
