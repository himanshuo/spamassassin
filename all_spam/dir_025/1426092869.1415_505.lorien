Interestingly, when a friend told us about Da Pasquale on Sunday, it had 4.5 stars, and by the time we got there on Monday, it had 4 stars, which I would say is definitely a more accurate rating.  I would say it's right around 3.5 stars, maybe 4 if comparing to other restaurants in the immediate area (places in Beverly Hills are usually more about the scene and location than the food, and Da Pasquale is in the heart of it), so I will round up.
