Consumer bruce@untroubled.org,

An insider in Washington D.C. has just totally exposed 7 Hazardous Pharmaceuticals the US Federal government can't wait for you to ingest.

If only I was able to say this was merely a conspiracy theory, unfortunately, this whistle-blower has actual information Big Brother is shoving hazardous prescription pills down your throat ... and laughing all the way to the bank, while you're sick as a dog.

Who knows how long The List will be public before the Administration bans it... so don't wait a moment more. 

Go here right now for the entire full list and story "they" don't want you to be aware of,

Paul Amos
