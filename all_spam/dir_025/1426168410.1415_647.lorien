Like that ol' saying goes...you get what you pay for. Simply amazing!!!

Celebrated my sister in laws birthday and our 3rd baby announcement...couldn't of asked for a more perfect setting. The ambience was that of a Vegas scene-- music was popping and so were the bottles. Steaks are top quality, very flavorful and perfectly cooked. I ordered the bone-in ribeye, medium with a chard on the outside; my wife the fillet, sister and brother in law, the new your strip and ribeye as well . Our steaks were so hot that we had to let them sit a little while before we could begin eating-- this is a good thing. I don't know 'bout you Pedro, but not a fan of cold steaks.
