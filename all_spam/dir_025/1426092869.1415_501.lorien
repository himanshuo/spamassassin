I've been here many times, and without a doubt this is some of the most authentic Italian food you can get in the city.

You'll leave the table feeling full from the generous portions. The Gnocchi Roll is absolutely amazing, wonderful texture, fully warm all throughout, and with a perfect ratio of gnocchi to ricotta / spinach that I have yet to have topped.

The second dish I would highly recommend is the Pasta Bolognese, once again another very authentic Italian dish that makes my mouth water every time I even think about it. The noodles are done the traditional Italian way, al dente, the sauce isn't overbearing or too much, and the meat blends in very well with the dish. It's perfect.
