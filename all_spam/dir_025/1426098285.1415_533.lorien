Cull & Pistol was my number one go to HH oyster place, but this place has now taken the spot. Despite the fact that they only let you choose 3 varieties versus more at Cull & Pistol, the oysters were so meaty and the hot sauce was this special slightly sweet habanero sauce. Not only that, but the service was great. Good music, good vibes all around... Even fellow customers at the bar seemed happy and it was infectious. It was so good that when you exclaimed how good it was, random customers nodded in agreement.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

Unless you want to cab it, your best bet is hop on the 6 train to Astor Pl and then take a nice little stroll over.

If you didn't know it yet, Upstate is a seafood restaurant and proudly serving some of the best and freshest oysters in town, Oh did I mention a great selection of craft beer.

We entered at 5:45pm on a Wednesday night and the place was pretty much packed already.  The restaurant itself is not big, there's a bar that sits around 10 and then wooden rectangular tables that can probably fit another 25- 30 people or so.  The place is lightly dimmed and gave a very cozy feeling.

The waitress was extremely friendly, she sort of knew we had no idea of what oysters to order so she suggested a sampler or each, so we ended up both getting the happy hour deal with 4 types of the most popular oysters on the menu. and then on top of that, we also ordered a fish plate (forgot what the fish is) and an order of crab cake.

Oyster first- I am not a big oyster person and I probably can't even tell what's a good oyster from a bad one but what I can tell you is those oyster are probably some of the freshest sweetest and cleanest oysters I have tasted in a while.  I ditched all the sauces and just went straight with it's sea water flavor and it was just delicious!! and perfect with the beer.

The fish  was tasty and perfectly cooked, you know that fish is fresh because it didn't taste rubbery and the texture of it was hard but with some elasticity.  
Crab cake was awesome and flavorful but a tad too salty for my taste.  but I do have to say the salad that comes with it was delicious. it's got this honey balsamic glaze on it and it was perfectly balance, not too sweet nor tangy.

before our meal was over, our waitress brought us 2 pieces of whiskey infused pound cake and wow was it delicious!!! You can taste that whiskey but without the strong kick... definitely my type of dessert!f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
