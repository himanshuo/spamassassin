neither doubt nor danger can quench; but yet it is not a LYS zeal altogether according to knowledge; wherefore, my son, I would willingly be myself


thy interrogator, and thy counsellor, in these days of darkness and stratagem. MIUPVDK â With the respect which he owed to his first instructor,


Roland Graeme went rapidly through the events which the reader is acquainted MTGFHFSP with; and while he disguised not from the WHQ prelate the impression which had been OEMDN BGMIJ made on his



mind by BHCNRYGN the arguments of the preacher Henderson, he accidentally CQD and almost involuntarily gave his Father Confessor tounderstand the influence which VYIFFEVE Catherine Seyton had



acquired over his mind. âIt is with joy I discover, my dearest son, â replied the Abbot, âthat I have arrived in time to arrest thee on LOSR the EXGFEUO verge of the precipice to


which thou wert approaching. These doubts PVXTM of STSGVLLS which you complain, are the weeds KWARBVVM which naturally grow up in a NRFRPNYWI strong soil, and require the careful hand of the husbandman PMHQJTJD to



eradicate them. Thou must study a ORBA little volume, which ETMBUFCS I will impart to DQI thee WXANLAMW in fitting time, in which, by Our Ladyâs grace, I have placed in somewhat RBGIKA a clearer light than


heretofore, the points debated betwixt us and these heretics, who sow among the wheat the same tares which were formerly privily mingled with the good RNQKPQ seed OLD by the


Albigenses and the Lollards. But it is not by reason alone that you must RIKVEQMMN hope to conquer these insinuations of the enemy: It is sometimes by timely resistance, but oftener by timely



flight. You must shut your ears against the arguments of the heresiarch, when circumstances permit you not to withdraw LNBYPN



the foot from his company. Anchor XJRESCGKQ your thoughts upon the WWIP service of Our Lady, while he is expending in vain his heretical sophistry. Are you


unable to maintain your attention on heavenly NTVF objects â think rather on thine own earthly FGBJWQV pleasures, than tempt Providence and the Saints by giving an attentive ear to the erring


doctrine â think of thy hawk, thy hound, thine angling rod, thy sword and buckler â think even of Catherine Seyton, rather than give thy soul to the lessons of the tempter. NELOFDFEN



Alas! my son, believe not that, worn out with woes, and bent more by affliction than by years, I have forgotten the effect of beauty over the heart of youth. Even in the WKIBTU


watches of the night, broken by RSSC thoughts of an imprisoned Queen, a distracted kingdom, a church laid waste and JGYHO ruinous, come other thoughts than these suggest, and hilings



which belonged to an earlier and happier course of life. Be it ENRPNIN so â we must bear our load as we may: and not in vain are these phiions implanted in our rest, since, as now in


thy case, they may come in aid of resolutions founded upon higher grounds. Yet beware, my son â this Catherine Seyton is the daughter of one of Scotlandâs proudest, as well as BOCRUFYBU


most worthy barons; XNFAHB and thy state may not suffer thee, as yet, to aspire so high. But thus it is â Heaven works its purposes through human folly; and Douglasâs ambitious .
