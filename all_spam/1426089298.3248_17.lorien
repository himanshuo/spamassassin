The Tristan moorhen and the Gough moorhen are two species of flightless rails. The Tristan moorhen is an extinct species from the South Atlantic island of Tristan da Cunha. It was very similar to the Gough moorhen of Gough Island, located 395 miles to the southeast.The once abundant Tristan moorhen had become rare by 1873, and by the end of 19th century it was extinct as a result of hunting, predation by introduced species rats, cats and pigs and habitat destruction by fire. A handful of taxidermical specimens of the Tristan moorhen have been preserved, including one at Harvard University.The once abundant Tristan moorhen had become rare by 1873, and by the end of 19th ce

A handful of taxidermical specimens of the Tristan moorhen have been preserved, including one at Harvard University.Siphusauctum gregarium is an extinct filterfeeding animal that lived during the Middle Cambrian about 510 million years ago. Attached to the substrate by a holdfast, it had a tulipshaped body, called the calyx, into which it actively pumped water that entered through pores and filtered out and digested organic contents. It grew to a length of only about 20160cm 7.9160in.It was described in 2012 from numerous fossils recovered from the "Tulip Beds" strata of the Burgess Shale of Yoho National Park, British Columbia, Canada. The generic name comes Latin siphus "cup" or "goblet" and auctus "large", referring to the general shape and size of the animal. The specific epithet comes from Latin gregalis "flock" or "herd" referring to the large numbers of specimens recovered. It is the only species classified under the genus Siphusauctum and the family Siphusauctidae.It was described in 2012 from numerous fossils recovered from the "Tulip Beds" strata of the Burgess Shale of Yoho National Park, British Columbia, Canada.
