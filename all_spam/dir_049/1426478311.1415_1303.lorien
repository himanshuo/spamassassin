We ordered the mediterriean platter, 17713861 mussels, and bread and oil to share for starters.  Everything was lovely and presented beautifully.  The broth with the mussels was amazing.  The food arrived pretty quick and the waitress was very nice.

I then ordered the venison haggis and got a side 17713861 of whisky cream sauce.  This is up there with the best haggis I have ever had.  The portion was excellent for the price aswell.  Others at my table ordered roast chicken, olive oil poached salmon and lamb with a side of chips. Everyone was very impressed with their dishes and how good they looked, yet at great prices!
