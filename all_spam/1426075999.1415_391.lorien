The organising body is the Edmonton City Dart League which has been in existence since 1946.A SIMM, or single inline memory module, is a type of memory module containing randomaccess memory used in computers from the early 1980s to the late 1990s. It differs from a dual inline memory module DIMM, the most predominant form of memory module today, in that the contacts on a SIMM are redundant on both sides of the module. SIMMs were standardised under the JEDEC JESD21C standard.Most early PC motherboards 8088based PCs, XTs, and early ATs used socketed DIP chips for DRAM. As computer memory capacities grew, memory modules were used to save motherboard space and ease memory expansion. Instead of plugging in eight or nine single DIP chips, only one additional memory module was needed to increase the memory of the computer.Most early PC motherboards 8088based PCs, XTs, and early ATs used socketed DIP chips for DRAM.

Such barrows were "princely burials", being of high status individuals who would have been members of the social elite within their local tribal group. Some of the most prestigious were "chamber burials", containing a richly furnished wooden chamber within the mound, but in others the corpse had simply been buried into the ground and had a mound erected on top.Early AngloSaxon burial involved both inhumation and cremation, with burials then being deposited in cemeteries. At this time, the AngloSaxons adhered to a pagan religion, but as Christianity was introduced in the seventh century, it gradually became the dominant and eventually sole religion amongst the AngloSaxon kingdoms. Many of those buried in barrows were pagan, but others were instead Christian, and it is usually impossible for archaeologists to know which religion an individual belonged to.Early AngloSaxon burial involved both inhumation and cremation, with burials then being deposited in cemeteries.
