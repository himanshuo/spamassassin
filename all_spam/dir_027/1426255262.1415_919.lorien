<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Typically, I am not a fan of drip coffee.  I am a die hard espresso lover and would rather skip drinking coffee if espresso isn't available.  All that was true until this past weekend when I walked into Philz.  Besides the fact that they brew each cup to order, the variety of flavors and intensity of the beans is outstanding.  I have never come across anything like that before.  Because it was our first time visiting, the staff were extremely patient and helpful in providing the guidance we needed to pick a blend that was going to be best suited to our preferences.  I really appreciated the help because the menu is overwhelming with how many flavored beans are available. 

Philz offers the standard bold, medium, light and decaf strengths.  What's not standard are the blends available in each category.  For example, I ordered something called: Jacobs Wonderbar, which was "named in honor of Phil'z only son Jacob. Each memorable sip boasts delicious layers of nuts and chocolate filled with a full-bodied flavor and finished without any acidity or bitterness. Jacob's Wonderbar brew is a dark roast favorite!"

My husband ordered the Philtered Soul, "A medium dark roast coffee at its sweetest. The Philtered soul has a burst of chocolate with an overwhelmingly satisfying aftertaste sure to please your souls' deepest desires. A favorite of all coffee drinkers who posses a sweet tooth. Note: This blend may contain traces of hazelnut."

They will add cream and sugar to taste if drinking black coffee isn't for you.  However, with coffee this good, it might be a sin to have it any other way than black!  

Thanks to Philz, I have another reason to visit San Fran!f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
