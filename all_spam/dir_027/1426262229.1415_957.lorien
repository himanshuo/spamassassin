<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">I was looking for something in between the Washington Monument and Ford's Theater that would be open for brunch around 10am on a Sunday and across the Internet OEG kept coming up as a classic/timeless DC spot so to Opentable I went to make the reservation.

Service:  Overall pretty good but there is an issue which keeps this place from being five stars that I'll get to in a moment.  We were promptly seated in nice booth and our guy "C" gave us a nice walk thru of the menu including house specialties along with his personal favorites.

So far so good, right?  So what could be the issue?  


Again, not snobby or nasty just each server had too many tables and they were being far too cordial with people they knew which slowed it down big time for the rest of us.

Food:  For DC the adult menu prices are not outrageous and it's nice with brunch that you can go anywhere from apple French Toast, to a burger to oysters and everything on the menu in between.

The old lady hit some type of quiche and I did the crab cake sandwich. The portion size on both the quiche and the crab cake were fairly small but both had decent flavor.  I'm a quasi-crab cake snob and while this wasn't the best that I've ever had it was a solid attempt that I would get again if we ever came back.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
