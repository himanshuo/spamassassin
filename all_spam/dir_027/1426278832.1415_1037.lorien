The method is based on the averaging principle when the exact differential equation of the motion is replaced by its averaged version. The method is named after Nikolay Krylov and Nikolay Bogoliubov.Various averaging schemes for studying problems of celestial mechanics were used since works of Gauss, Fatou, Delone, Hill. The importance of the contribution of Krylov and Bogoliubov is that they developed a general averaging approach and proved that the solution of the averaged system approximates the exact dynamics.Various averaging schemes for studying problems of celestial mechanics were used since works of Gauss, Fatou, Delone, Hill.
