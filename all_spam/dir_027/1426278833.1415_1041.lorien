Its first product was a WWVB ReceiverComparator, an instrument used to calibrate oscillators with traceability to national standards. Other early products included WWVB frequency and time standards which offered atomic clock accuracy at a fraction of the cost. This led to widespread use of these products in vital communications networks such as twoway police radio simulcast systems and master clocks for accurate time stamping of data and events within emergency call centers such as 911 public safety answering points. When GPS signals became publicly available in the 1990s, Spectracom offered its time and frequency products with embedded GPS receivers. These products are known by the registered trademarks Ageless and NetClock, the second being a popular brand of network time servers and master clocks.Spectracom was founded in Rochester, New York USA in 1972.
