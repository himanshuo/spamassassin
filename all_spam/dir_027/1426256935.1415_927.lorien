The place itself is nothing special with disappointing decor but it's all about the food and service so the good news is that both were great! We arrived a few mins after happy hour ended and our server told us the unfortunate news. Luckily the girl next to her saw me take out my yelp app and came right over to ask, is it your first time? We'll extend it for you...:) Woo hoo! We were thrilled because we wanted to try happy hour out first! 

Started with the tuna tostada, amazing! Sweet and fresh and the perfect way to start our meal! Also a very delicate & modern presentation.
