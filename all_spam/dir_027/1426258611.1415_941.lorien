Before I even ordered my breakfast I knew I wanted to try one of their scones, they looked soo good , well in fact all of their baked goods looked amazing, but I stuck with the chocolate scone, it came with cream and raspberry preserve, the scone with cream & preserve on top it was just pure heavenly bliss. This time I was glad I ordered with my eyes.  I also ordered a double espresso & latte too.  After checking out the rest of the menu I went with Smoked Bacon with leak potato cakes,  this dish was amazing,  it was over easy eggs on top of smoked bacon which was resting on the potato cakes and some roasted cherry tomatoes,  it was perfect.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">I want to live on the side streets next to Happy Fatz so I can come here every day.

My brother told me amazing things about this place, so my friend and I came to check it out. I missed it at first because I honestly was not expecting my brother to have eaten in a cute little place that looked like a quaint little house (no offense to my brother). There is a lot to park in, but it's pretty small but there were plenty of open spots on the streets nearby. 

This place was way more awesome than what I expected. They have so many kinds of cool "gourmet" hot dogs (the woman who helped me said the Clucker and the Texas Chili Dog were the most popular), salads, and breakfast food, but I think their main attraction is the dog situation. 

The hot dogs are all Hebrew national (which are all kosher, right?), but they do have veggie dogs for an extra 25 cents so you veggie heads don't have to miss out on the fun :) I decided on the Al Capone, a Chicago style dog in a poppy seed bun, per the suggestion of my brother. IT WAS THE BEST HOT DOG EVER. I don't think I'll ever be able to return to my ketchup/mustard/relish ways of the past. My friend opted for the "build your own dog" option, and had a large amount of topping, bun, and condiment options to choose from. You get a choice of a chips, fries, or fruit. I had the fruit, and got a little bowl of berries, apples, oranges and grapes. None of that gross mixed melon business that you find other places. 

We were too full, but they had an impressive display of cheesecake, cake balls, and other goodies. A woman was icing an Italian cream cake as we stopped to admire. She said that everything is homemade! Next time I'll save room.

They have Italian sodas, coffees, and a wide selection of Republic of Tea teas. Indoor and outdoor seating. I saw a BYOB sign on my way out. Good to know!

I can't wait to go back!f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
