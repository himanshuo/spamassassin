Seriously - it's been over six months since I've initial stop to Ballard's Morsel and Bean! Revisited with college friend who just returned from Kauai and the Big Island. 
As a creature of habit, I ordered a Fast Break on a cheddar chive biscuit and 12 ounce mocha  I was kindly treated by college friend. She ordered biscuits and gravy and a 12 ounce latte - her first major meal since returning from her island hopping.

Let's just say the food and coffee remained consistently delicious from my perspective. It was a challenge to listen to her island travelogue while savoring tasty goodness.  Tomato jam! Cheesy, eggy, bacony - mmmmm. Despite the crowds, it was nice to be able to sit at the counter, soak in the late winter sunshine, savor this breakfast treat, and catch up. Try that at Caf?? Besalu, and one is likely to get major stink-eye from the folks in line.
