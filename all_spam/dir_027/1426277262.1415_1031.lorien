I found this place while I was looking for a new sandwich shop to try out. Don't let the exterior deceive you!! Yes it may be small inside, offering only a few tables and window seating, but this place is so much more! We were immediately greeted by the enthusiastic gentleman behind the counter who asked if it was our first time. After we agreed, he kindly went over the menu selections and gave recommendations as well as the back story to the place. LOVE how this place was taken over by a group of good friends who grew up in the neighborhood! The have a small garden out back where they grow their some of their own ingredients. What other sandwich place do you know that offers gourmet popcorn in a wide variety of flavors to accompany your grilled sandwich?
