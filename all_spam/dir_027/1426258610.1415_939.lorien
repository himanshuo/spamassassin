<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">This place is amazing. I don't normally write reviews, but I have to get the word out that if you are in Midtown, you have to check this place out.

Drinks: Every beer on the menu is worth trying. Ghettoblaster is what got me hooked but the IPA is a keeper too. They also make their own sodas (or "pop" for us Michiganders).

Food: As far as I know, the only brick oven pizza place in the area, and boy can you tell the difference. This stuff is like an art form when they present it to you, and my favorite is the Sopla Fuego, a spicy italian sausage pizza with a kick of habanero.  Also, hands-down the best spinach artichoke dip I've ever had. 

Service: Service is top notch, but on busy days they can get swamped. They only have one oven for the pizza, so you can be waiting for a little bit if they're busy, but they are always quick to refill your drinks. Zach has been my waiter a few times and he's the man.

Like some other people said, the parking lot out front is for Traffic Jam across the street, but they've added 6 Motor City spots along the East side of the lot, and 14 spots behind the place as well. They are all labeled though so if you don't see a sign for Motor City parking, you will get towed. 

If you're in Midtown, stop by for a drink or grab some food. They open the upstairs patio sometimes too so that's always nice in the summer. I've been going for a few years and have never been disappointed.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
