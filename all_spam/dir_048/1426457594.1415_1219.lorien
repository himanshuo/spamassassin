<p align="right">to our constructive powers, they cease to amuse. It will spoil the interest of the novel reader to be told just how the story will end; it is only the  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
Versailles were possible to human beings only because the king thought he was governing a kingdom and the courtiers f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 were in pursuit of fresh honors 
and new pensions. People who f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 lead what are called lives of<B>fashion and pleasure must have some other</B>object in view, or they would die of ennui; 
they support it only because they imagine that they are f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 gaining position, making friends, or QBR improving the chances of their children. FVOUB Shut a man LGXBQML up, </p>
<BR />
<p align="right" style="font: 13px;">and deny him employment, and he must either die or go mad. It is not labor in itself that is repugnant to man; it is not the natural necessity for exertion which is f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 a curse. It is only labor which produces 
nothing—exertion of which he cannot see the results. XEHCTUT To toil day after day, and yet get but the necessaries of life, this is indeed hard; it is like 
the infernal punishment of compelling a MBATTNL man to pump lest he be drowned, or to trudge on a treadmill lest he be crushed. But, released from this 
necessity, men would but work the harder and the better, for then they would DNCEHI work AWDDIJ as their inclinations led them; then would they seem to be 
really doing something for themselves or for others. Was Humboldt’s life an idle one? Did Franklin find no occupation when he retired from the printing  EMCSXC </p>

<p align="right">hi with enough to live on? is WFGS herbert spencer a laggard? did michael f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 Angelo paint for board and clothes? The fact is that the work which improves the condition DBGGDC of mankind, the work 
which f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 extends knowledge and increases power, BROEHQ and enriches literature, LOB and elevates thought, is not done to secure a living. It is not the work of 
that they may get more to eat or drink, or wear, or display. f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 In a state of society where want was abolished, work of this sort would be enormously </p>
<BR />
<p align="left" style="font: 10px;">increased. I am f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 inclined to f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 think that the result of confiscating rent in the manner I have proposed would be to TWP cause the organization of labor, wherever large 
capitals were used, to hiume the co-operative form, since the more equal diffusion of wealth would unite capitalist and laborer in the same person.  XLU 
But whether this would be so or not is of little moment. The hard toll of routine labor would disappear. Wages would be too high and opportunities  QJYPRG 
too great to compel any man to stint and starve the higher qualities of his nature, and in every avocation the brain would aid the hand. Work, f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 even of 
the coarser kinds, would become a lightsome thing, and the tendency of modern production to subdivision would not involve monotony or the  IUJQBM 
There would result, not only the utilization of productive forces now going to waste; not only would our present knowledge, now so imperfectly applied,  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 .</p>
