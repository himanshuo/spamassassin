It succeeded the Vilafrancada 1823 and foreshadowed the Portuguese Civil War 18281834.On 30 April 1824, Infante Miguel, who had been appointed generalissimo of the Portuguese Army, had top civilian and military people of the country arrested and placed in the dungeons of the Castle of So Jorge and the Tower of Belm.
