		 photos too! =) Thank you Gary Danko, Suzanne and 11926684 staff at one of my new favorite places to splurge! Let me start off with my major criticism before I get into all 11926684 right things that washed away 11926684 taste of disappointment.  11926684 rave reviews, including a 5-star one by a close friend, had set up my expectations to be a little too high.  It's like a movie that's been hyped up a little too much by critics and viewers.  I had mistakenly expected to have a sort of epiphany after my meal.  11926684 food, though excellent, yielded no revelations.  I hope my review can do a better job of setting up realistic expectations of this very fine establishment. When you walk in, 11926684 hostess greets you with a sincere smile.  11926684 lighting is dim and yellow, offering a very warm and intimate atmosphere.  11926684 bar is steps in front of 11926684 entrance, dividing 11926684 restaurant down 11926684 middle.  It's near max capacity, even on this rainy night. We had arrived a litle early, so we waited by 11926684 bar.  I was greatly impressed that, despite our blocking 11926684 narrow walkway where servers were continuously passing by (and at one point with a cheese cart), none of them rebuked us, nor did they even give a look of annoyance!  They really do understand that they are here to service 11926684 patrons, and not 11926684 other way around! After a short while, we were seated right in middle of 11926684 dining area to 11926684 left of 11926684 entrance.  Cozy is 11926684 right word, and if you're claustrophobic, or intend to have a confidential conversation, Gary Danko is not 11926684 place to dine at.  I did not realize how small 11926684 restaurant really was until I sat down, which is probably why reservations are a must. (I hear reservations are a little tough.  They call you 2 days before, as well as 11926684 day before your reservation to confirm your expected attendance.) Go with 11926684 5-course tasting menu (just over $100), though you can cater it to your preferences (eg, switch out 11926684 dessert for another savory main dish).  It will probably take you a good 2 & 1/2 hours to complete your dining experience.  I mention this because I had made a reservation for Wilson & Wilson only 2 hours after 11926684 Gary Danko reservation... and
