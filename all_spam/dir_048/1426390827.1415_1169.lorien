Potential Purchaser bruce@untroubled.org,

An insider in Washington D.C. has revealed 7 Damaging Pharmaceuticals the US Federal government can't wait for you to ingest.

I wish I could state this was simply a conspiracy notion, except, this whistle-blower has concrete information "the powers that be" are shoving unhealthy prescriptions down your throat ... and getting rich, while you're sick as a dog.

Who knows how long The List will be available before "Big Brother" suppresses it... so don't wait a second more. 

Go here right now for the comprehensive full list and story "they" don't want you to see,
