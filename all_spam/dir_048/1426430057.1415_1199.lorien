Hi,

I just saw a video that chilled me to the bone... 
and I am unbelievably grateful I saw it... 
before it was too late.

It turns out that we may be a lot less safe than
we think in terms of our health and our ability 
to even SURVIVE through the coming years.

John O'Dowd, an expert in heart and blood health,
has been kind and giving enough to make a video 
to teach us how to spot the coming signs of a stroke
or heart attack... 
AND three ways to solve it...
http://www.got-for-new.eu/3408-194-216-3270187/bruce/tindex10.html

The scariest part for me was that these signs are often
"symptom free," meaning you would often have NO idea the
alarm bell is running until your system is completely 
on fire and about to burn down.
http://www.got-for-new.eu/3408-194-216-3270187/bruce/tindex10.html

At that point, you're either dead... 
or if you're "lucky,"... you're being pushed by an 
orderly in a wheelchair following a stroke.

Please don't put your life to chance.  
Watch this video.

"We are pleased to have reached an agreement that is good for workers and f=
or the industry," said PMA President James McKenna and ILWU President Bob M=
cEllrath in a joint statement. "We are also pleased that our ports can now =
resume full operations."

Negotiators for the union and PMA began formal talks in May. Their previous=
 six-year contract expired July 1.


USA TODAY
Perez gives 2 sides in West Coast port talks Friday deadline
In a statement released late Friday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest sai=
d President Obama has called on the parties to now work together on backlog=
s and congestion as the agreement moves forward.

"This is great news for the parties involved in the negotiation and a huge =
relief for our economy -- particularly the countless American workers, farm=
ers and businesses that have been affected by the dispute and those facing =
even greater disruption and costs within further delays," Earnest said.

Those who depend on reliable shipments through the ports expressed relief a=
t word of the tentative accord. But they aren't predicting normal operation=
s anytime soon.

"We know that even upon ratification, clearing up the congestion will take =
months," says Peter Friedmann, executive director of the Agriculture Transp=
ortation Coalition.

He says agriculture "has taken a beating" as a result of the dispute, leadi=
ng overseas customers to shop in other nations for meat, fruit, hay, cotton=
, rice, nuts, french fries and lumber.

Likewise, the National Retail Federation issued a statement hailing the bre=
akthrough, but saying the bargaining system needs to be reformed.

"As we welcome today's news, we must dedicate ourselves to finding a new wa=
y to ensure that this nightmare scenario is not repeated again," the associ=
ation said. "If we are to truly have modern international trade, supply cha=
in and transportation systems, we must develop a better process for contrac=
t negotiations moving forward."

Perez says that when he joined negotiations, the remaining big sticking poi=
nt involved the arbitration system to resolve disagreements. The agreement =
should create a more efficient system, he says.

Under current rules, neutral arbitrators preside over labor disputes betwee=
n workers and PMA.

If negotiations had moved to Washington, it could have meant that the White=
 House was potentially considering invoking Taft-Hartley. Officially the La=
bor Management Relations Act of 1947, it allows presidents to get involved =
in labor disputes. In his statement, Earnest noted that President Obama had=
 been kept apprised of the situation in recent weeks before dispatching Per=
ez.

However, for the president to invoke it, there would have to be either a st=
rike or a lockout in effect.


USA TODAY
Voices: Labor dispute brings eerie stillness to L.A. port
The last time Taft-Hartley was used was in 2002, when President George W. B=
ush forced West Coast ports to open. In that instance, port employers locke=
d port workers out for 10 days because of what they called a union slowdown=
.
